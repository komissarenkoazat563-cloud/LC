# Product Images and Media: How Visual Assets Are Handled

Media is one of the most visible quality signals after a shopping cart migration. If images are missing, mis-attached, or out of order, customers lose interest fast.

We will focus on what typically goes wrong and how to validate media continuity in a practical way.

#### What “product media” includes

Media can include:

* Main product images and galleries
* Variant-specific images
* Videos or rich media, depending on the platform
* Alt text and other descriptive fields that support accessibility and SEO

The biggest issue is association: media must be attached to the right product and, when relevant, the right variant.

#### Why media issues happen during migration

Common patterns include:

**Association differences**\
Platforms may store image associations differently, especially when images are tied to specific variants.

**Ordering differences**\
If the gallery order changes, the product presentation can shift. This matters for products where the first images drive purchase decisions.

**Duplicate and missing assets**\
Large catalogs can contain duplicates, broken links, or inconsistent image sources. Migration can surface these issues.

**Format expectations**\
Platforms can differ in how they expect image URLs or uploads to be stored. This can affect how images render on the new storefront.

#### How to validate media effectively

Validate the storefront experience, not only backend views. The customer’s view is what matters.

Use a sample that includes:

* best sellers
* image-heavy products
* products with variant-specific images
* products in top categories

Check:

* images exist and appear on the correct products
* variant images change as expected
* gallery order supports decision-making

#### How Next-Cart reduces media-related launch risk

Media issues are best caught through sampling and early review, not full-catalog inspection.

What Next-Cart does:

* **Priority sampling:** focuses on products where media is most critical (best sellers, complex products, image-dependent categories)
* **Demo Migration proof:** migrates a representative sample so you can inspect real product pages early
* **Validation guidance:** aligns review on presence, association, and gallery integrity for priority products

**Outcome**: you avoid the common “the site looks wrong” problem after go-live.

#### Best practices

* Validate best sellers first
* Validate products with variant-specific images
* Confirm gallery order for conversion-critical products
* Include media in your definition of “migration success,” not as an afterthought

#### Common pitfalls

* Checking a few simple products and assuming media is fine everywhere
* Missing variant-specific image issues until customers report them
* Ignoring the gallery order, which can impact conversion
* Not prioritizing best sellers first

#### Conclusion

Media continuity is conversion continuity. Plan to validate it early, especially for best sellers and products where imagery is essential for selection.

If your catalog is image-heavy or relies on variant images, use a **Demo Migration** or **Request a Demo by Next-Cart** to validate media association on priority products before officially migrating to the new shopping cart.
