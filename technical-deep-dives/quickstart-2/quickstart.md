# Blog and CMS Content: What Transfers and What Must Be Rebuilt

Blog posts and CMS pages can be major traffic drivers, but they do not behave like products or orders. Content is often tied to a platform’s theme, editor, URL structure, and rendering model. That is why blog migration can “work” while still changing page layout, internal links, and SEO signals in ways that reduce performance.

This article helps you decide what content should transfer, what usually must be rebuilt, and how to validate content continuity before a shopping cart migration goes live.

### What “blog and CMS content” usually includes

Most stores use content in multiple forms:

#### Blog posts and guides

Editorial content that drives discovery, links, and long-tail organic traffic.

#### CMS landing pages

Campaign pages, brand pages, category-like content pages, and evergreen landing pages.

#### Supporting assets

Images, embedded media, downloadable resources, and internal links that connect content to products and categories.

The planning point: content success is not “the text exists.” It is whether the page still communicates the same intent, remains reachable, and continues to earn traffic.

### What usually transfers cleanly

#### Core text and basic structure

Headings, paragraphs, and basic formatting can often be moved, especially for simpler posts.

#### Primary media, in many cases

Images and featured images often transfer, though association and formatting can change.

#### Categories and tags, sometimes

Taxonomies may transfer, but naming, hierarchy, and display behavior can differ.

Transfer is most reliable when content is stored in a straightforward way and does not rely heavily on platform-specific layout features.

### What often must be rebuilt

#### Layout and page templates

Many platforms render content using different template systems. Even when the text transfers, the page may need rebuilding to match your design and conversion intent.

#### Embedded elements and interactive blocks

Tables, accordions, embedded widgets, and custom blocks frequently require manual recreation or platform-specific alternatives.

#### Internal link patterns

Links that point to old product/category URLs or old blog paths often need review to avoid broken paths or irrelevant destinations after cutover.

#### On-page SEO signals tied to rendering

How headings, structured sections, and content blocks are rendered can change across platforms, which can influence how search engines interpret a page.

**Expert insight**: content migration fails most often when teams focus on copying pages rather than preserving page intent and pathways. The fastest traffic loss comes from broken entry pages and broken internal linking, not missing old posts no one visits.

### The content continuity decision: preserve versus rebuild

A practical way to decide is to separate content into two groups:

#### Preserve (migrate) when

* the page earns meaningful traffic or links today
* the page intent is still accurate and valuable
* the page structure is simple enough to transfer without breaking meaning
* you can keep the URL path or redirect it cleanly to an equivalent page

#### Rebuild when

* the page relies on platform-specific layout features
* the page intent should be updated for the new platform or new positioning
* the page’s conversion purpose matters more than the exact original layout
* the content is outdated and should be refreshed rather than copied

This is not about perfection. It is about protecting the pages that matter most.

### How to scope content migration without making it endless

#### Start with a “priority content set”

Include:

* top organic landing content pages
* top-linked guides and evergreen posts
* campaign or brand pages that still receive visits
* high-intent pages that influence product discovery and conversion

#### Decide what happens to the long tail

For older or low-value posts, you may choose to:

* migrate them later
* consolidate them into fewer, better pages
* exclude them if they no longer serve a purpose (with a plan for redirects if needed)

The goal is to avoid spending time preserving content that does not protect traffic or conversion.

### What to validate before go-live

Validate content like a customer and like a crawler:

#### Reachability

* priority content pages load correctly
* old entry paths still reach the right destinations (via continuity or redirects)

#### Intent preservation

* the page still answers the same question it used to answer
* the content still aligns with the keywords and audience it served

#### Internal linking sanity

* links to products, categories, and related content point to valid destinations
* the most important internal paths still exist (not necessarily every historical link)

#### Presentation and trust

* pages look credible and readable
* images and key sections appear where they influence comprehension

### How Next-Cart supports content continuity decisions

Next-Cart helps teams reduce risk by treating content continuity as a planned scope decision:

* identify which content pages are worth preserving because they drive traffic and links
* define what should be rebuilt to match the target platform’s content model
* ensure validation includes priority entry pages and internal pathways that influence discovery

The goal is that your most valuable content keeps working as an acquisition asset after the platform change.

### Conclusion

A practical industry takeaway is that content continuity is less about copying pages and more about preserving intent and pathways. Stores lose traffic when priority content pages disappear, URLs shift without clear equivalents, or internal links break across the new site. When you prioritize the content that actually earns visits, decide what should be preserved versus rebuilt, and validate reachability and intent before go-live, you protect the part of your store that brings customers in.

If content-driven SEO is meaningful for your store, start by defining a priority content set (top landing pages, top-linked guides, and campaign destinations) and decide which pages should be preserved versus rebuilt for the new platform. If you want expert help auditing which pages are worth migrating and what should be refreshed instead, reach out via Live Chat. Next-Cart can help you scope content continuity risk and align on the safest service approach to protect traffic and key entry pages during migration.

### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I migrate blog posts to Wix?</strong></summary>

In many cases, blog content can be migrated, but results depend on how the target platform stores content and how your current system structures posts, categories, and media. If content is a major traffic driver, treat blog migration as an explicit scope item and validate a representative set before go-live.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I migrate only blog posts published after a certain date?</strong></summary>

Sometimes. Selective migration can be useful when older posts are outdated or low value. However, it's crucial to first analyze which content actually drives traffic and whether older posts still attract valuable backlinks or maintain search rankings before excluding them. Removing high-value content, regardless of age, can negatively impact your SEO.

To implement a data filter for migration, you will typically need to leverage a Custom Migration Service. This model will enable you to apply a specific filter to exclude any data published before your chosen date.

<summary><strong>Will all blog content migrate perfectly without changes?</strong></summary>

Not always. Content text may transfer, but layout, embeds, and templates can behave differently on the target cart. Plan for review and selective rebuilding.

<summary><strong>Do policy pages really affect conversion?</strong></summary>

Yes. Shipping and returns pages reduce anxiety at checkout. They also reduce support load by answering common questions before purchase.
