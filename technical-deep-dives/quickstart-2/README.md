# Content and Marketing Continuity

When people think about shopping cart migration, they usually think about products, customers, and orders. But marketing performance is often shaped by a different layer: your content, promotions, and on-page signals.

This section explains what typically carries over cleanly, what often needs rebuilding, and how to plan marketing continuity so you do not launch a new store that feels incomplete or loses momentum.

**Expert insight:** Content and marketing continuity rarely “fails” because of one missing page. It fails because teams do not define which assets are critical, then they validate too late.

### What this section covers

You will learn:

* What happens to blog posts and CMS pages during migration
* Why promotions and coupon rules can behave differently across carts
* What changes in SEO metadata and on-page content when you change carts

### How Next-Cart can help you

Next-Cart helps reduce marketing disruption by treating marketing-critical data as part of migration scope and validation, not as an afterthought.

What Next-Cart does:

* Helps you define what content and promo assets are business-critical
* Supports a Demo Migration so you can review real migrated samples early
* Helps you identify where “representation differences” are likely (content templates, promo rule behavior, metadata fields)

This is not about moving every asset. It is about preserving what protects traffic, conversion, and trust.

### Conclusion

Marketing continuity is easier when you treat it like a migration deliverable. Define the assets that matter most, validate representative samples early, and plan what must be rebuilt so nothing is discovered after launch.
