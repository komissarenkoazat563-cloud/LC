# How to Choose Next-Cart Migration Service Model

Choosing a migration service model is less about “which tier is best” and more about matching the level of help to your store’s complexity, risk tolerance, and internal capacity. The right model makes the work predictable: scope is clear, outcomes are validated early, and responsibilities are unambiguous at go-live.

This article explains how to choose between **Standard Migration**, **Managed Migration**, and **Custom Migration** using the evidence you gather using Demo Migration and then carries that decision through the rest of the migration journey.

### What actually determines the right service model

Most customers make a better choice when they evaluate three factors together:

#### 1) Store complexity

Complexity signals often show up in the demo or in early requirements review:

* variant-heavy catalogs with inconsistent option values
* deep or curated category structures that drive browsing and SEO intent
* attributes used for filtering and discovery
* third-party extensions or custom fields that affect storefront behavior
* promotions with rule behavior that must remain predictable
* “custom cart” needs (a platform outside the standard supported list)

When these are present, the safest model is the one that reduces execution and mapping risk.

#### 2) Internal capacity and ownership

Ask this honestly:

* Do you have time and confidence to operate the migration tool?
* Who owns validation and sign-off?
* Can your team review outcomes quickly enough to keep the project moving?

Service model fit improves when it matches your team’s available time, not just technical comfort.

#### 3) Proof requirements before go-live

Some businesses need higher confidence because the cost of disruption is higher:

* high-traffic stores with SEO sensitivity
* stores with revenue-critical promotions
* stores with tight go-live windows or peak season constraints
* stores where customer support depends heavily on order history

If you need stronger proof with less internal execution burden, Managed or Custom can be the safer choice.

### The three service models, explained in outcome terms

#### Standard Migration

What it is:

* You run the migration tool yourself.
* Next-Cart provides 24/7 expert guidance and assistance.
* You are responsible for operating the migration and validating the results.

Best fit when:

* your scope is straightforward and your demo results look predictable
* your team can run the process and perform validation without bottlenecks
* you want expert mentoring rather than full execution

What you gain:

* maximum control over timing and runs
* on-demand expert support when questions arise

What you must be ready to own:

* operating the migration workflow
* reviewing outcomes and signing off on readiness

#### Managed Migration

What it is:

* A Next-Cart expert manages and executes the migration end-to-end.
* Your primary responsibility is validating outcomes against expectations.
* 24/7 expert support is included.

Best fit when:

* you want to reduce internal workload and execution risk
* you need faster progress without relying on internal tool operation capacity
* your project has tight timing or high stakes, and you want expert-led execution

What you gain:

* expert-managed flow through connection, mapping alignment, and full execution
* internal time shifts toward review and sign-off rather than operation

What you must be ready to own:

* validation of outcomes and expectation alignment decisions

#### Custom Migration

What it is:

* One or more **Custom Jobs** modify the migration tool to meet special requirements.
* Then a Next-Cart expert runs the migration for you.
* You validate the final result.
* 24/7 expert support is included.

Best fit when:

* demo results or requirements review show special handling needs that standard capabilities cannot cover
* you must migrate custom fields, third-party extension data, or non-standard structures
* you are migrating to or from a “Custom Cart” platform outside the supported list

What you gain:

* customized capability to preserve what matters when default migration cannot
* expert execution after customization so results are consistent with the plan

What you must be ready to own:

* validation of the final outcomes and acceptance decisions

### How to choose using a simple decision checklist

Use this quick set of questions after your demo and consultation:

#### Choose Standard Migration if:

* your demo results are predictable for your representative sample
* you can run the process internally and validate outcomes
* you do not see strong signals of custom requirements

#### Choose Managed Migration if:

* you want Next-Cart to run the process end-to-end
* internal capacity is limited, or execution ownership is a risk
* you need a more controlled project flow with less operational burden

#### Choose Custom Migration if:

* demo results show missing or mismatched data tied to customizations
* you have special data requirements that must be preserved
* you need Custom Jobs to adapt the tool for your store or platform pairing

If you are unsure, the safest next step is usually to run a representative Demo Migration and review results with an expert before committing.

### How service model choice affects responsibilities across the journey

The biggest difference is who executes the work versus who validates outcomes.

* **Stage 1 (Demo)**: service model does not change your progress. Use this stage to identify complexity and choose safely.
* **Stage 2–3 (Connection and Mapping)**: Standard means you operate with expert guidance; Managed and Custom mean Next-Cart operates.
* **Stage 4 (Full Migration and Validation)**: Standard means you run and validate; Managed and Custom mean Next-Cart runs and you validate.
* **Recent Data Migration**: the customer initiates and can runs Recent Data Migration whenever needed.

**Expert insight**: Most migration stress comes from unclear ownership. The “right” service model is often the one that removes your biggest ownership risk, whether that risk is operating the tool or validating outcomes fast enough to keep the project on track.

#### Conclusion

A practical industry takeaway is that service model selection becomes easy when you treat it as a responsibility decision backed by proof. Run a representative Demo Migration, identify complexity signals, and decide what you can confidently own internally versus what you want Next-Cart to execute for you. When responsibilities are clear and validation ownership is explicit, the migration becomes predictable and go-live confidence becomes earned.

If you are deciding between Standard, Managed, and Custom Migration, start by validating a representative demo sample that includes your real complexity, especially best sellers with tricky variants, key browsing paths, and any custom fields that influence storefront behavior.

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I still need to validate results if I choose Managed or Custom?</strong></summary>

Yes. The goal is to make validation easier and more reliable, not to eliminate it. Even with expert execution, you still want to review the areas most likely to impact customers and operations, such as product structure, variants, navigation, customers, orders, and URL continuity planning.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the most common signs that I need a Custom Migration?</strong></summary>

Common signals include data stored in third-party modules or custom fields, special transformation rules, and business-critical behaviors that must match precisely in the target store.

If you are unsure, **When Custom Job Is Required: Common Scenarios** is the most direct way to sanity-check your situation.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Is Managed Migration only for large stores?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. Managed Migration is often chosen because of timeline pressure, limited internal bandwidth, or the cost of mistakes, not only because of store size.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How do I avoid choosing a service model based on guesswork?</strong></summary>

Use a Demo Migration as evidence. A small, representative demo tends to reveal whether your store behaves like a standard case or whether special handling and deeper guidance are needed.
