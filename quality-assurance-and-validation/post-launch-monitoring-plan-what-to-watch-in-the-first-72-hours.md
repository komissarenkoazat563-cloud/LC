# Post-launch Monitoring Plan: What to Watch in the First 72 Hours

The first 72 hours after go-live determine whether a migration launch feels stable or turns into reactive firefighting. This window is when customers, staff, and search engines first interact with the new store at real volume. Small issues that were invisible during pre-launch review can become expensive quickly if they affect conversion, order processing, or reachability of priority pages.

This monitoring plan gives you a practical, outcome-focused checklist for the first three days after launch. It helps you detect high-impact failures early, prioritize what to fix first, and separate normal post-launch volatility from true migration issues.

### Why the first 72 hours matter

Immediately after launch, you typically see:

* real customer browsing patterns that stress navigation and product behavior
* real orders that test operational workflows
* real traffic hitting legacy URLs and redirects
* search engines recrawling pages and reassessing structure

The goal is not to eliminate all issues. The goal is to catch the handful of issues that can cause outsized damage if they persist.

### Monitoring mindset: prioritize business impact

Use this priority order:

1. **Conversion and purchase-critical behavior**
2. **Order flow and operational usability**
3. **Reachability of high-value pages and redirect gaps**
4. **SEO volatility signals worth tracking**
5. **Lower-impact cleanup and polish**

**Expert insight**: In most migrations, only a small number of issues drive most of the risk. Monitoring is successful when it finds those issues fast, not when it collects lots of low-value observations.

### The first 72 hours monitoring plan

### Day 0–1: Immediate stability checks (first few hours)

Focus: confirm the store can sell reliably and customers can complete the most common paths.

Checklist:

* **Top browsing paths work**
  * top categories load correctly and show plausible product sets
  * key navigation pathways are not empty or mismatched
* **Best sellers behave correctly**
  * key products load
  * variant selection behaves logically for representative products
  * pricing and availability look plausible for high-impact items
* **Cart and checkout outcomes are stable**
  * the store can complete a normal purchase flow without obvious failures
* **Priority landing pages are reachable**
  * campaign landing pages, top organic entry points, and key informational pages load correctly

If anything fails in these areas, treat it as urgent. These are the issues most likely to impact revenue immediately.

### Day 1–2: Operational and order flow monitoring

Focus: confirm that the business can operate the store day-to-day.

Checklist:

* **New orders are visible and usable**
  * orders are coming through and can be interpreted operationally
  * support and operations can reference the information they need
* **Customer creation and identity look consistent**
  * new customers are being created correctly
  * there are no obvious identity anomalies that affect service workflows
* **Order-related workflows are understandable**
  * statuses and totals appear consistent with how the new platform represents them
  * operational teams know what differences are expected platform behavior versus anomalies

Note: some operational differences are normal after changing platforms. Your job is to detect differences that break workflows or confuse support teams.

### Day 2–3: Reachability and traffic continuity monitoring

Focus: confirm that high-value traffic is not being stranded and priority pages remain discoverable.

Checklist:

* **Redirect coverage for high-value legacy URLs**
  * top legacy URLs resolve to correct new equivalents
  * you do not see important pages hitting dead ends
* **Priority pages remain reachable**
  * top categories and best sellers load consistently
  * key informational pages remain accessible
* **Internal navigation still supports discovery**
  * category browsing makes sense
  * key collections or curated pathways still function

This is where you prevent the most common long-tail problem: traffic slowly leaking because legacy entry points are not resolving correctly.

### What to track every day during the 72-hour window

You do not need to track everything. Track signals that quickly reveal whether the store is healthy:

#### Customer experience signals

* reports of “can’t find product” issues
* variant selection problems
* broken category browsing paths
* cart or checkout friction

#### Operational signals

* order processing confusion (missing context, unexpected totals, unclear statuses)
* customer support signals that order history or customer records are hard to use

#### Traffic and reachability signals

* high-value legacy URLs landing on irrelevant pages or dead ends
* unexpected drops in reachability for priority pages
* evidence that internal navigation is not connecting users to products effectively

#### Expected volatility to watch but not panic over

* short-term ranking fluctuations
* temporary crawl behavior shifts
* minor formatting and content display differences

The key is to identify what is expected versus what is a true break in outcomes.

### A simple triage system for issues

When you find an issue, categorize it and prioritize it:

#### Severity A: launch-blocking or revenue-impacting

Examples:

* purchase path failure
* best sellers unreachable
* major categories empty or mismatched
* widespread redirect failures for high-value pages

Action: Address immediately.

#### Severity B: high-impact but not fully blocking

Examples:

* key filtering or variant inconsistencies for important product sets
* operational usability issues that slow down support
* important landing pages not mapping as expected

Action: Resolve quickly and re-validate.

#### Severity C: low-impact or expected differences

Examples:

* formatting differences
* minor content shifts
* low-value pages with redirect gaps

Action: Track and address in backlog.

If needed, classify the root cause:

* mapping decision
* scope decision
* platform capability difference
* custom requirement

This helps you avoid treating every issue as a crisis.

### How Recent Data Migration relates to post-launch monitoring

Recent Data Migration is primarily a pre-launch freshness tool, but monitoring should still consider data freshness:

Checklist:

* Confirm new orders and customers are flowing correctly after launch.
* If you performed multiple Recent Data Migration runs pre-launch, ensure the target store did not enter go-live with an unacceptable freshness gap.

Post-launch, the focus shifts to the live store’s normal data flow.

### How service model affects support during the monitoring window

Regardless of model, 24/7 expert support is included. The key difference is what you are owning post-launch:

* **Standard Migration:** you operated the migration. Post-launch monitoring focuses on validating that outcomes remain stable and prioritizing issues clearly.
* **Managed Migration:** execution burden is reduced. Your monitoring focus is still on outcomes and operational readiness.
* **Custom Migration:** monitoring is particularly important for the customized areas to confirm that the special requirements behave as intended at real-world volume.

### Conclusion

The first 72 hours after launch are about protecting customer experience, revenue, and trust. If you monitor the highest-impact pathways first, track operational usability, and verify reachability for priority entry points, you can catch the few issues that cause most migration pain. A simple triage system prevents overwhelm, and clear ownership keeps the launch calm even when small issues appear.

If you want a stable launch week, prepare a short monitoring checklist before go-live that covers best sellers, top categories, a few purchase scenarios, and your highest-value legacy URLs.
