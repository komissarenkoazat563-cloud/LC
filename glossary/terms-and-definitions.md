<table><thead><tr><th width="100">Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>301 Redirect</td><td>A 301 redirect is an HTTP status code that permanently redirects one URL (web address) to another.<br><br>It is a critical, SEO-friendly method used during a migration to tell search engines that a page has moved, ensuring that the original page's search rankings and "link equity" (authority) are passed to the new page.</td></tr><tr><td>302 Redirect</td><td>A 302 redirect is an HTTP status code that signals a web page has been temporarily moved.<br><br>Unlike a 301 (permanent) redirect, a 302 tells search engines that the original URL will be used again in the future.<br><br>Because the move is not permanent, search engines typically do not pass "link equity" (ranking power) to the new URL, and the original page remains indexed.<br><br>This is often used for short-term changes, such as running a promotion, A/B testing a new page design, or redirecting users based on language/location.</td></tr><tr><td>API (Application Programming Interface)</td><td>An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.<br><br>In e-commerce, APIs are used to connect an online store to third-party services like payment gateways, shipping carriers, and inventory management systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Application Migration</td><td>This is the process of moving an entire software application, including its data and configurations, from one computing environment to another.</td></tr><tr><td>CMS (Content Management System) Data</td><td>This refers to the non-product, non-transactional content on an e-commerce site.<br><br>During a migration, this data typically includes static pages (like "About Us" or "Contact Us") and all blog posts.</td></tr><tr><td>Customer Data</td><td>This is one of the most critical types of data transferred during a migration.<br><br>It includes all customer profiles, personal information (names, emails), saved shipping/billing addresses, and customer reviews.<br><br>Migrating this data accurately is essential for maintaining customer relationships.</td></tr><tr><td>Customer Experience (CX)</td><td>CX is the overall impression and holistic journey a customer has with a brand across all interactions.<br><br>This includes everything from viewing a digital ad and browsing the website to the checkout process and post-purchase support.<br><br>A poor customer experience due to a slow or inflexible platform is a primary driver for e-commerce migration.</td></tr><tr><td>CRM (Customer Relationship Management)</td><td>A CRM is a system that allows businesses to manage and analyze all customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle.<br><br>For e-commerce, this involves tracking personal details, purchase history, and customer service interactions.<br><br>The goal is to improve customer relationships, automate marketing, and increase customer retention and loyalty through personalized experiences.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Cleansing</td><td>Data cleansing is the critical process of identifying and then fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incomplete, duplicate, or improperly formatted data within a dataset.<br><br>In a data migration, cleansing is performed to improve data quality before loading it into the new system, which prevents the transfer of "dirty data" and ensures long-term data integrity.<br><br>This often involves tasks like deduplication and correcting inconsistencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Integrity</td><td>Data integrity is the concept of ensuring the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its entire lifecycle.<br><br>Preventing data loss or corruption (a loss of integrity) is a primary challenge in any migration.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Mapping</td><td>Data mapping is the process of matching data fields from a source database to the corresponding fields in the target database.<br><br>This "blueprint" is the crucial first step in any data migration or integration project and ensures that data (e.g., "SKU" in the old system) is correctly placed in the corresponding field (e.g., "Item Code" in the new system).<br><br>Incorrect mapping is a major cause of migration failure.</td></tr><tr><td>Database Migration</td><td>This is the process of transferring an entire database from one system to another.<br><br>It must be done carefully to avoid data integrity issues or format mismatches.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Migration Validation</td><td>This is the formal process of ensuring that data has been transferred accurately, completely, and securely from the source system to the target system.<br><br>It involves validation checks at all stages: pre-migration (profiling source data), during migration (tracking records), and post-migration (reconciliation reports).<br><br>The goal is to verify data completeness, correctness, and consistency, ensuring that all data adheres to the new system's business rules and logic.</td></tr><tr><td>Database Schema</td><td>A database schema is the logical "blueprint" or framework of a database.<br><br>It defines the structure, including its tables, the columns (fields) within those tables, the data types for each column (e.g., text, number), and the relationships between tables.</td></tr><tr><td>Database Schema Migration</td><td>This is the process of managing and applying changes to a database's structure (its schema), such as adding a new column to a table.<br><br>This is distinct from data migration, which is the process of moving the actual data within the schema.</td></tr><tr><td>Delta Migration</td><td>Also known as an "incremental" migration, this process transfers only the new or modified data that has appeared on the source system after an initial, full migration has already been completed.<br><br>In e-commerce, this allows a store to remain live and accept new orders during the migration, with the "delta" of new orders and customers being moved just before the new site goes live.</td></tr><tr><td>Downtime</td><td>Downtime is the period when a system, service, or website is unavailable to customers.<br><br>Minimizing downtime during a migration is a critical goal, as any interruption can lead to direct financial losses, decreased customer satisfaction, and a negative impact on brand reputation.</td></tr><tr><td>E-commerce Migration</td><td>This is the technical process of moving an online store from one platform (the "Source Cart") to another (the "Target Cart").<br><br>This transfer includes all critical business elements, such as product data, customer information, sales history, and design components.</td></tr><tr><td>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)</td><td>ETL is a foundational process in data management, often used in data migration and warehousing.<br><br>It involves three phases:<br>- Extracting data from one or more source systems<br>- Transforming the data (which includes cleaning, formatting, and applying business rules) into a structure suitable for the new system<br>- Loading the processed data into the target database or data warehouse</td></tr><tr><td>Full Data Migration</td><td>This is the process of transferring all needed data from one platform to another in a single operation , as opposed to a Delta Migration, which only transfers new or changed data.</td></tr><tr><td>Headless Commerce</td><td>Headless commerce is an e-commerce architecture where the front-end presentation layer (the "head" or storefront) is decoupled from the back-end commerce engine.<br><br>The two systems communicate using APIs.<br><br>This approach provides significant flexibility, allowing brands to create unique, high-performance customer experiences across various touchpoints (e.g., websites, mobile apps, smart devices) without being limited by the front-end templates of a traditional, monolithic platform.</td></tr><tr><td>Kitconnect</td><td>Kitconnect is a proprietary software package (specifically, a PHP script) used by the migration service like Next-Cart.<br><br>For self-hosted, open-source platforms like WooCommerce or Magento, the user must upload this package to their website's root folder.<br><br>It acts as a secure "connection bridge" that allows the migration tool to access and read the store's data.</td></tr><tr><td>Migration Assistant (or Migration Tool)</td><td>This is a software application designed to simplify the migration process.<br><br>E-commerce platforms often provide these "assistants" or "importers" to guide users through step-by-step data transfers.<br><br>Next-Cart, for example, provides a web-based migration tool that turns the process into a few simple steps.</td></tr><tr><td>Order Data</td><td>This is a core data entity transferred during a migration, representing the store's complete sales history.<br><br>It includes order numbers, customer details, purchased items, payment and shipping status, and transaction dates.</td></tr><tr><td>PIM (Product Information Management)</td><td>A PIM is a system or process used to manage all the information required to market and sell products.<br><br>It acts as a central hub for all product-related data; such as descriptions, pricing, specifications, and media; and ensures this information is accurate and consistent.<br><br>PIM systems integrate with e-commerce platforms and other tools to streamline the distribution of product information across all sales and marketing channels.</td></tr><tr><td>Product Data</td><td>This is a core data entity transferred during a migration.<br><br>It includes all product listings, such as SKUs, product categories, descriptions, pricing, product variants (e.g., size and color), and all associated images.</td></tr><tr><td>Project Scope</td><td>A formal project management document that determines and lists specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, budget, and a timeline.<br><br>In a website migration, the scope defines exactly what data, pages, and functionalities are being migrated and helps prevent "scope creep" (uncontrolled changes).</td></tr><tr><td>Recent Data Migration</td><td>This is Next-Cart's proprietary brand name for a "Delta Migration".<br><br>It is a feature that allows a user to transfer only the new entities (products, customers, orders) that have been added to the Source Store after the initial full migration was completed.<br><br>This is typically done just before the new site goes live to ensure it is 100% up-to-date.</td></tr><tr><td>Re-Migration</td><td>A feature offered by migration services like Next-Cart that allows the user to run the entire migration process again, as many times as needed, from the same source store.<br><br>This is often used to run test migrations on a staging site before performing the final migration on the live production site.</td></tr><tr><td>Replatforming</td><td>This is the strategic decision to select and switch to a new e-commerce platform.<br><br>This is distinct from "migration," which is the technical act of moving the data. Businesses typically replatform to gain new features, improve performance, enhance scalability, improve customer experience, or reduce high maintenance costs.</td></tr><tr><td>SEO Preservation (Website SEO Migration)</td><td>This is the formal process of moving a website to a new platform while protecting its existing search engine performance.<br><br>The goal is to retain keyword rankings, organic traffic, and backlink authority. Failing to do this can "wipe out years of digital investment". A critical component of this process is the correct implementation of 301 redirects.</td></tr><tr><td>Source Cart</td><td>The "Source Cart" is the e-commerce platform or shopping cart that a merchant is migrating from.</td></tr><tr><td>SSL Certificate (Secure Sockets Layer)</td><td>A small digital file installed on a web server that enables a secure, encrypted connection.<br><br>An SSL certificate authenticates a website's identity and is what enables the "https" prefix and the padlock icon in a browser's address bar.<br><br>It is essential for any e-commerce store to protect sensitive customer data, such as credit card numbers and login credentials.</td></tr><tr><td>Target Cart</td><td>The "Target Cart" is the e-commerce platform or shopping cart that a merchant is migrating to.</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</td><td>A financial calculation of the full cost of operating an e-commerce platform, which extends beyond the initial setup or licensing fee.<br><br>TCO includes all hidden and ongoing costs, such as hosting, frequent maintenance, security updates, and developer hours.<br><br>A high TCO is a common driver for replatforming to a more modern, cost-efficient system.</td></tr><tr><td>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</td><td>UAT is the final phase of the testing process where real end-users (such as the client, employees, or a beta group of customers) test the new system to validate that it meets all business requirements in a real-world scenario before the "go-live" launch.<br><br>Unlike technical QA testing (which checks if the system was built correctly), UAT validates if the right system was built for the business's needs.</td></tr></tbody></table>
