# QA Validation Worksheet

#### What this worksheet helps you decide

Validation is where confidence is earned. This worksheet helps you decide:

* Is the migrated data accurate enough to operate your store?
* Which areas need more attention before launch?
* What issues are acceptable and what must be fixed?
* Which problems indicate a scope mismatch or missing requirements?

It is designed to move validation beyond “counts match” into “behavior works”.

#### How to make validation meaningful

**Use representative samples**

Your samples should include:

* Best sellers and high-revenue products
* High-variant and complex products
* Priority categories and navigation paths
* High-traffic URLs
* A mix of customer records and orders that represent real edge cases

**Write acceptance criteria that can be repeated**

Good acceptance criteria are concrete:

* “Variant options display correctly and pricing is consistent across variants”
* “Order history shows correct totals and line items for selected sample orders”
* “Redirect from old path resolves to intended new path for priority URLs”

#### How to customize it

Add checks that reflect your store reality:

* Product attribute expectations
* Category navigation requirements
* SEO metadata priorities
* Content pages that drive conversions
* Post-migration operational checks that reflect your daily workflow

The worksheet is meant to match your business, not the average store.
