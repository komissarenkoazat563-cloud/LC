# Migration Risk Register Template

#### What this template helps you decide

Migration risk is not just technical. It includes process risk, business risk, and timing risk.

This template helps you decide:

* Which risks matter most right now?
* What must be mitigated before launch?
* What issues should be monitored rather than solved immediately?
* When should your service approach change because risk is too high?

#### How to write the correct strong risks

A strong risk is specific and testable:

* Weak: “SEO might drop.”
* Strong: “High-traffic URL paths do not map cleanly to the new site structure, causing redirects to fail for priority pages.”

#### How to judge the risk correctly

Scoring should guide attention, not create false precision.

* **Likelihood**: how probable the risk is
* **Impact**: how damaging the risk would be if it happens

#### How to customize it for your business

Useful additions include:

* “Business impact area” (revenue, operations, support load)
* “Mitigation owner” if different from the risk owner
* “Validation check link” tying risks to QA items
* “Decision threshold” describes when a risk triggers a change in approach

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Do we need to mitigate every risk?</strong></summary>

&#x20;Not necessarily.

Some risks are simply monitored, others are accepted as part of the process, and certain risks must be addressed before launch. Using a risk register helps you make these important decisions intentionally and confidently.

<details>

<summary><strong>How often should we review risks?</strong></summary>

Ideally, you should review them at least twice: once after the **Demo Migration** review and again during the **final QA phase**.

Regular risk assessments help ensure smooth sailing throughout the project.
