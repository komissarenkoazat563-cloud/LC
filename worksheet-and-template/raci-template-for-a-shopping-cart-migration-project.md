# RACI Template for a Shopping Cart Migration Project

A RACI prevents the most common migration delay: tasks that stall because everyone thought someone else owned them.

RACI definitions:

* **R** Responsible: does the work
* **A** Accountable: approves final outcome
* **C** Consulted: provides input
* **I** Informed: kept in the loop

#### Roles to include

Adjust to your team:

* Business Owner
* Project Manager
* Technical Lead or Agency
* Marketing and SEO Lead
* Customer Support Lead
* Next-Cart (service provider)

If the planning phase feels stuck, you can reach out via **Live Chat** anytime to get expert support and discuss your migration needs and expected results with our technician, then optimize and finalize your plan based on the conversation.

We also recommend using the **Demo Migration** function as a structured decision checkpoint, then finalizing your RACI based on the real issues that appear.
