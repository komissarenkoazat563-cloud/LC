# RACI Template for a Shopping Cart Migration Project

#### What this template helps you decide

RACI prevents decision paralysis. During migration, delays often come from unclear ownership, not technical complexity.

This template helps you answer:

* Who actually does the work?
* Who approves decisions and sign-offs?
* Who must be consulted before choices are locked?
* Who should be informed so they do not block later?

#### When to use it

Use RACI as soon as you have a working group and decision-makers. Update it after evidence arrives, especially after a **Demo Migration**, because real complexity can change roles and responsibilities.

#### How to use RACI for migration decisions

A practical way to use RACI is to map it to these decision areas:

* Scope definition and success criteria
* Data mapping and exceptions
* Validation rules and acceptance criteria
* Redirect strategy and coverage
* Go-live readiness

If you cannot assign one accountable decision owner, your timeline risk increases.

#### How to customize it

Common customizations:

* Add a “Decision deadline” column for approvals
* Add a “Evidence required” column for sign-off conditions

Keep the structure simple. The more complex the RACI becomes, the less likely it will be used.

#### Next-Cart insight

If you are using the Next-Cart migration service, many teams include a Next-Cart Specialist to consult on the scope, mapping interpretation, and validation review. This helps reduce ambiguity and speeds up decisions when demo results reveal unexpected complexity.

If the planning phase feels stuck, you can reach out via **Live Chat** anytime to get expert support and discuss your migration needs and expected results with our technician, then optimize and finalize your plan based on the conversation.

We also recommend using the **Demo Migration** function as a structured decision checkpoint, then finalizing your RACI based on the real issues that appear.

#### FAQs

<summary><strong>Can RACI use roles instead of names?</strong></summary>

Absolutely, it depends on your team's structure and workflow. Choose the approach that best ensures clarity, efficiency, and adaptability for your current setup.

<summary><strong>What if multiple people must approve?</strong></summary>

To streamline the process, assign one clear owner who is responsible for the final decision, and list others as consulted parties.

Having multiple accountable individuals can sometimes lead to confusion and a lack of clear ownership.
