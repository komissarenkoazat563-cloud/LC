# Redirect Planning Worksheet

#### What this worksheet helps you decide

Redirect planning protects discoverability and customer journeys during change. This worksheet helps you decide:

* Which URLs must remain accessible after launch?
* What should the old paths map to on the new site?
* Which redirects are tested and ready for cutover?
* Where do you still have coverage gaps?

#### Redirects are mainly about URL paths

A URL is Domain plus URL Path. Redirect planning is usually a path-to-path problem, not a domain problem.

Redirect rules are applied on the new website. After domain cutover, requests to old paths can resolve to the intended new paths through your redirect system.

#### How to prioritize without overworking it

Start with High priority:

* Top traffic pages and landing pages
* Top revenue product pages
* Top category pages that drive discovery
* Campaign URLs used in paid media

Then expand coverage based on impact rather than trying to redirect everything equally.

#### How to customize it

Common customizations:

* Add “Traffic value” or “Revenue value” columns
* Add Source 2 for multi-source inventory
* Add “Redirect intent” when one-to-one mapping is not possible
* Add “Owner” if redirects are implemented by multiple teams

#### Common redirect mistakes to avoid

* Redirecting many old URLs to the home page instead of relevant destinations
* Creating redirect chains that slow crawling and dilute signals
* Forgetting category and blog URLs while focusing only on products

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Should we always use 301?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. Most migration redirects are 301s because they indicate a permanent change. However, if the change is only temporary, a 302 redirect is the appropriate option.

Understanding when to use each can help ensure your website redirects are effective and accurate.

<summary><strong>When is the best time to test redirects?</strong></summary>

It's advisable to perform testing prior to the cutover whenever possible, and then conduct a follow-up test after the cutover to ensure that real routing conditions are functioning correctly.
