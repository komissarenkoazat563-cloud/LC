# Redirect Planning Worksheet

Redirect planning protects traffic continuity when URLs change. It is also one of the easiest areas to leave too late.

A helpful way to remember what changes. A URL has two parts:

* Domain
* URL path

In most migrations, the redirect work is about mapping **old URL paths** to **new URL paths** on the new site.

Next-Cart’s SEO URL Redirects option is designed to migrate old URL paths into the redirect system on the new website so old URLs can lead users to the correct new destination after domain cutover.
