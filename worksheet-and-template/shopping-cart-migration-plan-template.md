# Shopping Cart Migration Plan Template

#### What this template helps you decide

A project plan is not just a schedule. In migration, it becomes a decision map that answers:

* What must be true before launch?
* What work is blocked by unresolved scope or unclear ownership?
* What tasks are dependent on evidence from validation?
* What outcomes signal that you are ready to proceed?

This template is built to track outcomes, not busywork. It is designed to reduce timeline risk and prevent late-stage surprises.

#### When it is most valuable

* Early planning when your scope is still uncertain
* After a **Demo Migration**, when you need to turn results into a concrete plan
* In the final stretch before launch, when dependencies and readiness matter most

#### How to think about milestones

Milestones should represent decision points and sign-offs, not internal meetings. Useful milestone patterns include:

* Demo review sign-off
* Scope confirmed
* QA sign-off
* Redirect plan ready
* Recent Data Migration complete
* Go-live
* Post-launch review

A good milestone means you can confidently move forward without reopening a previous decision.

#### How to customize it without weakening it

Make changes that support clarity:

* Add a column for “Decision required” to highlight approvals
* Add a column for “Entity Points estimate” if you want a planning signal for scope
* Add “Validation owner” if QA responsibility differs from task ownership
* Add “Risk ID link” to connect plan tasks to mitigation work

Avoid changes that increase ambiguity:

* Too many status values
* Tasks written as vague activities without a measurable outcome
* Dates without dependencies or ownership

#### Where Next-Cart reduces planning risk

If you plan to leverage the Next-Cart migration service, treat the **Demo Migration** as a planning anchor. It helps reveal where catalog complexity, relationships, or URL mapping may require more review, additional validation, or a different service level. That evidence can keep your plan realistic.

If your plan has multiple unknowns, reach out via **Live Chat** first to discuss your needs and expected outcome, and build the plan with a tailored, suitable migration approach.
