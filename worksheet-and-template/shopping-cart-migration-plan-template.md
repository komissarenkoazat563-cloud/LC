# Shopping Cart Migration Plan Template

A migration project plan is not a long document. It is a short agreement that answers:

* What we are migrating
* What success looks like
* Who owns decisions
* When we can launch with confidence

Use this template to create a plan you can share with internal stakeholders, agencies, and service providers.

#### Migration Project Plan Template

**1) Project snapshot**

* Project name:
* Source platform:
* Target platform:
* Launch target date (desired):
* Business owner:
* Project owner:
* Primary technical contact:
* Primary marketing and SEO contact:
* Customer support lead:

**2) Goals and non-goals**

**Goals**

* Example: Preserve purchasable product behavior for best sellers
* Example: Preserve order history for customer service continuity
* Example: Maintain traffic continuity for priority URLs

**Non-goals**

* Example: Redesign the entire catalog strategy during migration
* Example: Rebuild all historical marketing content on day one

**3) Scope definition**

**In scope**

* Products (including variants and media)
* Categories and catalog structure
* Customers
* Orders and order history
* Content types (blog, pages) if applicable
* SEO continuity inputs (URL paths, metadata) where applicable

**Out of scope**

* Custom features not represented in standard store data
* Third-party system logic unless explicitly included
* Post-launch redesign enhancements

**4) Data risk profile**

Check all that apply:

* High variant complexity (many combinations per product)
* Heavy use of custom fields or custom attributes
* Plugin, module, or extension dependence for core behavior
* Multistore or multi-channel complexity
* SEO-sensitive traffic dependence on legacy URLs
* Tight launch window

**5) Milestones and exit criteria**

Use simple milestones with clear exit criteria.

| Validation sign-off      | Business owner  | QA worksheet evidence           | Launch readiness confirmed            |
| Final sync completed     | Migration owner | Recent changes                  | Target store aligned for launch       |
| Go-live executed         | Project owner   | Redirect plan, readiness checks | Site live with monitoring active      |
