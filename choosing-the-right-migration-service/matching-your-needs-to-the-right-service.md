# Matching Your Needs to the Right Service

Beginners often choose a service model based on what sounds safer. A better approach is to choose based on predictable risk drivers.

This decision matrix is designed to help you select the model that matches your store’s reality, while keeping scope and effort controlled.

#### Decision matrix

<table><thead><tr><th width="176">Your situation</th><th>Standard Migration</th><th>Managed Migration</th><th>Custom Migration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Your data is mostly standard (products, customers, orders, basic content)</td><td>Best fit</td><td>Best fit</td><td>Usually unnecessary</td></tr><tr><td>Your team can allocate time for review and validation</td><td>Best fit</td><td>Best fit</td><td>Good fit</td></tr><tr><td>Your team has limited time or wants expert-led execution</td><td>Possible, but workload risk</td><td>Best fit</td><td>Best fit if custom needs exist</td></tr><tr><td>Your store relies heavily on third-party modules or custom-coded fields</td><td>Risky without custom handling</td><td>Risky without custom handling</td><td>Best fit</td></tr><tr><td>You need transformations or special mapping rules to preserve meaning</td><td>Not suitable</td><td>Not suitable</td><td>Best fit</td></tr><tr><td>You want to reduce uncertainty before committing to full scope</td><td>Discuss with an expert via Live Chat, and run a Demo migration first is recommended</td><td>Discuss with an expert to identify the expected outcome and running a Demo migration first is recommended</td><td>Discuss and clearly describe your needs with an expert and book a Demo migration is strongly recommended</td></tr><tr><td>You want a model that supports iteration before launch</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### How to use the matrix in a real decision

**Step 1: Identify your dominant risk driver**

Most stores have one dominant driver:

* **Complexity driver**: custom data, third-party modules, special rules
* **Capacity driver**: limited time, limited expertise, tight deadline
* **Confidence driver**: uncertainty about how data will behave on the target platform

**Step 2: Use the Demo Migration as your decision trigger**

A Demo Migration helps you answer:

* Does standard mapping preserve meaning for my complex products and key categories?
* Do I need expert-led execution to reduce operational risk?
* Do I have gaps that clearly require Custom Jobs?

**Step 3: Choose the model that reduces your dominant risk**

* If your risk is “I might choose the wrong scope” → start with Standard Service, utilize expert support and guidance from Next-Cart, plus a strong validation plan.
* If your risk is “we cannot run and manage this internally” → choose Managed Service. An expert technician will perform the migration and present the final result for your review and validation.
* If your risk is “our store has non-standard requirements” → choose Custom Service. Next-Cart's engineering team will work closely with you to tailor the migration tool to your specific needs and the capabilities of your target platform. You can then review and validate the migration results, ensuring everything aligns perfectly with your expectations.

#### A simple rule of thumb

* **Standard** is best when your store is standard, and your team can perform and handle the migration process.
* **Managed** is best when the project is standard, but your team wants an expert to execute the data migration, and you will be in charge of result review and validation.
* **Custom** is best when the store doesn’t fit a standard structure and requires expert handling with customized modifications to align with your needs, ensuring a smooth migration and that the data matches the target store’s capabilities.

#### Conclusion

Service selection is risk management. The right model is the one that reduces your most likely failure mode.

If you want a confident decision with minimal debate, run a **Next-Cart Demo Migration** on your most complex products, then use the results to choose Standard, Managed, or Custom based on evidence.

#### FAQs

<summary><strong>What should I do if I’m unsure whether to choose Managed or Custom?</strong></summary>

If your demo shows some unique data or special rules that need to be kept intact, opting for Custom Service is usually the safer approach.

On the other hand, if everything aligns with standard mapping but your main concern is the workload of execution, Managed often offers a streamlined solution.

Remember, selecting the right option can make a big difference in your workflow, so make sure to choose the perfect fit for your needs.
