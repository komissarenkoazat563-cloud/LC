# How to Choose Next-Cart Migration Service Model

When you are evaluating a shopping cart migration service, the biggest decision is not the target platform. It is the delivery model.

Most migration outcomes are determined by three practical factors:

* How complex your store data is
* How much time and attention your team can realistically commit
* How much risk you can tolerate in mapping and validation

Next-Cart offers three service models designed to match those realities: **Standard Migration**, **Managed Migration**, and **Custom Migration**.

#### The three service models of Next-Cart

**1) Standard Migration (you run the migration, with expert support)**

Standard Migration is built for teams that want control and are comfortable owning the project, but still want an expert safety net.

It is a “DIY with a pro” model:

* You lead and in charge of the migration run schedule and validation process
* Next-Cart support is always available to keep you unblocked and reduce guesswork
* It is best when your data is fairly clean and your requirements are straightforward

This is the most common starting point because it gives you visibility and flexibility without forcing you into an all-inclusive engagement.

**2) Managed Migration (Next-Cart runs the migration for you)**

Managed Migration is for teams that want the migration completed by experts, but do not need custom engineering work.

You are still involved in decisions, but you do not have to drive execution:

* Next-Cart runs the standard migration flow on your behalf
* You are in charge of reviewing and validating the migration result to ensure it meets your expectations and needs
* This model is best when your timeline is tight, internal bandwidth is limited, or you want expert-led handling for higher-stakes data

If your biggest risk is operational workload, Managed Migration is usually the correct step up.

**3) Custom Migration (Next-Cart handles special needs with custom modifications)**

Custom Migration is for stores where “moving standard data” is not enough.

It includes Managed support plus a defined Custom Job package to handle scenarios such as:

* Custom-coded fields or non-standard data structures
* Data living in third-party plugins, modules, or extensions that must be preserved
* Transformations or special mapping rules needed to maintain meaning on the target platform
* Special requests that require custom modifications to the migration tool infrastructure and technical settings.

If your store has unique rules that affect what customers see or how orders and customers behave, Custom Migration is designed for that reality.

#### How to choose quickly, using decision signals

Use these signals to choose the right model without overthinking it.

**Choose Standard Migration when**

* Your store is mostly standard ecommerce data: products, customers, orders, basic content
* You can dedicate time to review results and validate the outcome carefully
* You want control over timing and iteration
* You want the option to upgrade later if the demo reveals edge cases

**Choose Managed Migration when**

* You want to reduce workload and execution stress
* Your timeline is tight or coordination is difficult
* Your data is not extreme, but the risk of mistakes is costly
* You want an expert-led run and structured review guidance

**Choose Custom Migration when**

* You rely on third-party modules or custom data that must be carried over
* You require transformations, filtering, or special mapping rules
* You cannot accept “close enough” on critical data behaviors

#### A practical starting rule for beginners

If you are not sure which model you need, start by reducing uncertainty instead of debating hypotheticals.

A **Demo Migration** is the fastest way to reveal whether your store behaves like:

* A Standard project (clean mapping, predictable validation)
* A Managed project (mapping is fine but you want expert to perform the migration)
* A Custom project (special cases appear quickly)

#### Conclusion

The best service model is the one that matches your store’s complexity and your team’s capacity, not the one that sounds most comprehensive.

If you are deciding between Standard, Managed, and Custom, run a **Demo Migration** using your most complex products and your highest-value categories. Use those results as evidence to choose the right model with confidence.

Or, you can simply contact us through **Live Chat** to receive expert support and consultation tailored to your specific case and requirements. This will enable a comprehensive scope of the work and facilitate the determination of the most suitable approach for your migration plan.

<summary><strong>Do I still need to validate results if I choose Managed or Custom?</strong></summary>

Yes. The goal is to make validation easier and more reliable, not to remove it. A professional migration still requires reviewing high-risk areas like variants, navigation, customers, orders, and URL continuity.
