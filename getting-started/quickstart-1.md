# How to Use the Learning Center

Most replatforming projects fail for predictable reasons: unclear scope, underestimated complexity, rushed validation, and missing ownership across teams.

The Learning Center is organized to help you avoid those patterns by giving you the right information at the right time.

**Quick orientation:** If you do nothing else, learn what must remain true after launch for your store. That single step improves every decision that follows.

#### Step 1: Understand the basics first

Start with **Migration Fundamentals**. These pages explain:

* What a shopping cart migration is and what “good” looks like
* What store data includes, and how it connects
* Why data compatibility breaks
* How to think about SEO and redirects during platform change

#### Step 2: Identify complexity drivers early

Move to **Technical Deep Dives** when you want to spot hidden complexity, such as:

* Variants, options, and attributes
* Category trees and navigation structure
* Images and media handling
* Reviews and ratings as trust signals
* Taxes, discounts, coupons, and rule differences

**Expert insight:** Many teams discover complexity late because they validate only counts. Complexity reveals itself in relationships and behavior, not totals.

#### Step 3: Plan like a project, not a data transfer

Use **Strategy and Planning for Migration** to build your plan:

* A roadmap with milestones and decision points
* Roles and responsibilities, including a RACI model
* Data preparation and cleanup guidance
* A business case that accounts for risk and operational impact

#### Step 4: Use platform hubs as lenses, not instruction manuals

Platform Strategy Hubs highlight common differences and validation focus areas by platform. They are not setup guides. If a platform fact can change over time, it will be cited or described conservatively.

#### Step 5: Use checklists to validate and de-risk

Use **Post-Migration and Quality Assurance** for:

* A validation checklist you can use with any team
* A post-migration SEO audit plan
* A controlled go-live checklist
* A first 72-hour monitoring plan

#### Conclusion

Treat the Learning Center as a guided decision tool. Start broad, identify complexity, plan the project, then validate with checklists. That sequence is what reduces surprises and supports confident service selection.
