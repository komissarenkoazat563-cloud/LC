# Building a Migration Business Case: Cost, Risk, and ROI

A migration business case is how you get alignment. It translates “we want a new cart” into measurable reasons, expected outcomes, and acceptable risk.

Let's focus on business case logic for shopping cart migration and data continuity. It is not a sales pitch. It is a structured way to decide responsibly.

#### The three inputs stakeholders care about

A strong business case usually balances:

1. Cost
2. Risk
3. Return

The goal is not to promise perfection. The goal is to show that migration is a reasonable investment with a controlled plan.

#### Cost: what you are really paying for

Migration cost is usually a combination of:

* service cost for data migration execution
* internal time for decisions and validation
* rebuild work that is not migration, such as theme or layout changes
* post-launch stabilization time

**Expert insight:** Many teams underestimate internal cost because they treat validation as optional. Validation is the cost of confidence.

#### Risk: what can go wrong, and how you will control it

The most common business risks include:

* conversion impact caused by broken variants, navigation, or missing trust signals
* traffic disruption due to URL changes and incomplete redirect coverage
* operational burden caused by unusable order history or customer account confusion
* timeline risk caused by late discovery of compatibility issues

Risk control measures that make a business case stronger:

* defined scope and success criteria
* early proof through a demo-level validation run
* clear ownership for validation and launch decisions
* a monitoring plan for the first days after go-live

#### Return: what you can reasonably expect

Return depends on your original reason for migrating, such as:

* improved conversion opportunities through better storefront capabilities
* operational efficiency and reduced manual work
* marketing agility, faster content workflows, or better performance
* reduced technical limitations that block growth

Make "return" realistic. Tie it to measurable outcomes like page speed improvements, reduction in support tickets, or increased conversion rate targets, not vague statements.

#### How Next-Cart fits into the business case

Next-Cart can strengthen a business case because it reduces uncertainty and makes scope measurable.

Where Next-Cart supports business-case clarity:

* **Entity Points** quantify the data migration scope so stakeholders can compare options consistently
* **Demo Migration** provides evidence, so risk discussions are grounded in real results
* **Service model choice** supports risk ownership alignment
  * **Standard Migration** for a straightforward scope
  * **Managed Migration** when complexity and QA support are needed
  * **Custom Migration** when custom handling is required to preserve meaning
* **Recent Data Migration** reduces go-live risk for active stores by synchronizing changes close to launch

#### Conclusion

A good business case does not oversell. It clarifies costs, controls risks, and ties return to measurable improvements. If you can prove feasibility early and define success criteria, stakeholders are much more likely to align.

If you need approval, run a **Demo Migration** and use **Entity Points** to present scope, risk, and validation findings in a simple, evidence-based summary. Alternatively, **request Next-Cart** to perform a demo using your provided data.
