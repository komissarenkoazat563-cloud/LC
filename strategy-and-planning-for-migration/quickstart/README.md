# The Migration Project Roadmap

A shopping cart migration is not only a data move. It is a project with decisions, owners, timelines, and risk control. Stores that succeed tend to do the same few things consistently: define scope clearly, validate early, and avoid compressing QA into the final week.

This section gives you a practical roadmap so you can plan confidently, communicate with stakeholders, and choose the right level of migration support.

#### What this section covers

You will learn how to:

* Build a migration roadmap with realistic milestones and decision points
* Make a business case using cost, risk, and return, not guesses
* Assign ownership using a simple RACI so validation and launch do not become ambiguous

#### How to use this section

Read in order:

1. **Migration Roadmap: Timeline, Milestones, and Decision Points**
2. **Building a Migration Business Case: Cost, Risk, and ROI**
3. **Roles and Responsibilities: RACI for Replatforming Projects**

#### Where Next-Cart helps in planning

Many teams struggle because they cannot convert questions into evidence. Planning becomes emotional when nobody can prove what will happen to the data.

Next-Cart supports planning by turning unknowns into reviewable outputs:

* **Entity Points** help quantify migration scope early, so effort and cost discussions are grounded
* **Demo Migration** creates a proof point you can validate before you commit to full execution
* **Service model fit** (Standard, Managed, Custom) helps align risk ownership and internal workload
* **Recent Data Migration** supports active stores by synchronizing every changes

#### Conclusion

A roadmap reduces risk because it creates timing for decisions and validation. If you plan the sequence properly, migration becomes predictable instead of stressful.

If you are debating scope or timeline, start with **Entity Points** and a **Demo Migration** so decisions are based on evidence, not assumptions.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Why do migration plans go off schedule?</strong></summary>

Most delays come from unclear scope, unexpected complexity, and late validation. A roadmap fixes this by setting decision points and review gates early.

<details>

<summary><strong>Do small stores need a roadmap too?</strong></summary>

Yes. The roadmap can be simple, but you still need ownership for scope and validation.

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the fastest way to reduce planning uncertainty?</strong></summary>

A demo-level proof point. Seeing real sample results is more reliable than guessing based on exports.
