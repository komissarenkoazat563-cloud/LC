# Roles and Responsibilities: RACI for Replatforming Projects

A migration project fails when nobody owns decisions, validation, or go-live readiness.

A RACI model helps you assign responsibility clearly so the project moves forward without confusion.

RACI stands for:

* **Responsible**: does the work
* **Accountable**: owns the final decision and signs off
* **Consulted**: provides input before decisions
* **Informed**: kept updated

### Why RACI matters in migration

A migration has unavoidable decision points:

* what is in scope
* how complex data will be represented
* what “pass” means during QA
* when the store is ready to go live

If those decisions have no owner, the project either stalls or launches with uncertainty.

### A beginner-friendly RACI outline

Below is a practical role set many stores can adapt:

#### Business Owner or Project Sponsor

* Accountable for goals, budget, and timeline
* Approves scope and launch readiness criteria

#### Marketing Lead

* Responsible for content and campaign continuity planning
* Consulted on SEO priorities and redirect scope
* Informed about validation findings and launch timing

#### Operations or Support Lead

* Responsible for defining order history needs and customer experience expectations
* Consulted on what “usable” looks like for support and reporting

#### Technical Lead or Implementer

* Responsible for platform setup, integrations, and theme readiness
* Consulted on feasibility constraints

#### Migration Service Provider

* Responsible for migration execution under the chosen service model
* Consulted on mapping decisions and validation findings

#### QA Owner

* Accountable for validation plan and pass criteria
* Responsible for coordinating review and sign-off checkpoints

**Expert insight:** If you assign only Responsible roles but nobody is Accountable for sign-off, validation becomes endless or ignored.

### What to decide early

Before execution begins, define:

* Who is Accountable for scope and success criteria
* Who owns validation sign-off
* Who owns SEO continuity decisions
* Who owns go-live timing and monitoring

These are leadership decisions, not technical details.

### How Next-Cart supports clearer ownership

Next-Cart helps teams avoid ambiguity by providing artifacts that are easy to review and assign ownership around:

* **Entity Points** give a concrete scope number that stakeholders can approve
* **Demo Migration results** create reviewable proof for QA owners and business sponsors
* **Managed Migration** is useful when internal teams want the provider to take more responsibility for mapping and validation support
* **Custom Migration** clarifies when custom handling is needed so ownership is explicit, not discovered late

### Conclusion

RACI reduces friction by making decisions and sign-off visible. When roles are clear, migration becomes easier to manage and easier to approve.

If your migration project feels unclear, define a simple RACI and run a **Demo Migration** so each owner can review real results and make confident decisions.
