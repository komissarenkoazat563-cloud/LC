# Roles and Responsibilities: RACI for Replatforming Projects

A shopping cart migration touches every team that influences revenue: merchandising, marketing, support, operations, and technical stakeholders. Most migration problems are not caused by the data transfer itself. They come from unclear ownership: nobody owns validation, nobody owns SEO continuity, and approvals become informal.

A RACI model (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) helps you prevent that. This article gives you a practical RACI framework for migration projects so responsibilities are clear, decisions happen on time, and go-live sign-off is based on proof rather than assumptions.

### What RACI means in migration planning

#### Responsible

The person or team doing the work.

#### Accountable

The single owner who signs off on the outcome. Accountable is not a committee.

#### Consulted

Subject-matter experts who must be involved before decisions are finalized.

#### Informed

Stakeholders kept updated, but not involved in decision-making.

The simplest rule: every critical workstream needs one Accountable owner, or it will drift.

### The workstreams that require clear ownership

Migration projects usually fail where ownership is missing. These are the workstreams that deserve explicit RACI:

#### Scope and success criteria

Defining what is included, what is excluded, and what “success” means in measurable outcomes.

#### Data and catalog integrity

Ensuring products, variants, categories, media, and critical merchandising behaviors are correct.

#### SEO and traffic continuity

Owning redirect planning, priority page continuity, and post-launch monitoring expectations.

#### Content and marketing continuity

Owning content preservation vs rebuild decisions, priority landing pages, and campaign readiness.

#### Promotions and checkout behavior

Owning promotion scenarios, discount intent, and revenue-critical cart validation.

#### Customer accounts and order history usability

Owning realistic login outcomes, order history window decisions, and support readiness.

#### Integrations and operational dependencies

Owning any dependencies that affect order processing, fulfillment, analytics, or marketing workflows.

#### Validation and sign-off

Owning the validation plan, acceptance criteria, and the final go-live gate.

### How to make RACI actually work

#### Tie RACI to deliverables and deadlines

Ownership is only useful if it connects to concrete deliverables:

* validation sample definition
* acceptance criteria list
* sign-off checklist
* go-live readiness gate date

#### Avoid “everyone is accountable”

If two people are accountable, nobody is accountable. Keep one Accountable owner per workstream.

#### Use acceptance criteria as the bridge between teams

Each workstream should define what “pass” means in outcomes:

* “Best sellers can be purchased with correct variants and pricing”
* “Priority landing pages resolve and match intent”
* “Promo scenarios behave as expected”
* “Support can locate and interpret orders”

Expert insight: The fastest way to reduce migration risk is not more meetings. It is clarity on who owns proof. A RACI turns “we assumed someone checked that” into named sign-off owners.

### Conclusion

A migration RACI is not bureaucracy. It is the simplest tool for preventing invisible gaps: SEO continuity assumed but not owned, promotions recreated but not validated, support unprepared for login changes. When each workstream has a single accountable owner, consulted experts are included early, and go-live sign-off is based on acceptance criteria, migration becomes a controlled project rather than a stressful launch.

CTA paragraph: If your migration involves multiple teams or an agency, set up a RACI before execution starts and attach it to your validation plan and go-live gate.

### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Do small teams need a RACI?</strong></summary>

Yes. Your RACI can be simple, but you still need someone accountable for scope and validation.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the most common ownership gap in migration projects?</strong></summary>

Validation and acceptance criteria. Teams assume “testing will happen,” but nobody owns what to test, what “pass” means, and who signs off. RACI prevents that gap.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How do I prevent “endless QA”?</strong></summary>

Define pass criteria early and validate representative samples that reflect real customer and support workflows.
