# Data Preparation and Cleanup

Most shopping cart migrations do not fail because a platform cannot move data. They fail because the data was not prepared for predictable mapping and validation.

Data preparation is not busywork. It is how you reduce uncertainty, avoid last-minute surprises, and keep the migration timeline realistic. If you clean up the right things before execution, you shorten QA and lower the risk of launching with confusing catalog behavior.

**Expert insight:** The goal is not perfect data. The goal is data that behaves predictably when migrated.

#### What this section covers

You will learn how to:

* Prepare the right inputs before you purchase a migration service
* Think about data mapping as a strategy, not a technical task
* Fix the most common “dirty data” problems that create migration errors and conversion drops

#### The three buckets of preparation

Most preparation work fits into three buckets:

1. **Scope clarity**

* What must move, what can be rebuilt, and what success looks like

2. **Mapping readiness**

* How source data will be represented in the target cart, including key decisions

3. **Data quality readiness**

* Fixing inconsistencies that cause migration mismatches and confusing storefront behavior

#### Where Next-Cart helps during preparation

Preparation gets easier when you can convert assumptions into evidence.

Next-Cart helps you do that by:

* Using **Entity Points** to quantify migration scope early and align stakeholders
* Using a **Demo Migration** to reveal real mapping outcomes for complex products and categories
* Matching your situation to the right service model:
  * **Standard Migration** for straightforward scope and clear data structures
  * **Managed Migration** when you want more guidance on mapping and validation
  * **Custom Migration** when custom handling is needed to preserve meaning through Custom Jobs

#### Conclusion

Preparation reduces risk and accelerates validation. If you want the migration to feel controlled instead of stressful, start by clarifying scope, mapping decisions, and the few high-impact data issues that cause most surprises.

**One next step (CTA):** If you are not sure how complex your data is, start with **Entity Points** and a **Demo Migration** so your plan is based on real outcomes.
