# Data Preparation and Cleanup for Shopping Cart Migration

Most migration problems are not caused by the migration tool. They are caused by source data that is inconsistent, incomplete, or structured in a way that only made sense on the old platform. Data preparation is how you reduce risk before execution: you clarify what you have, what must stay true, and what needs to be cleaned or mapped differently so the target store behaves correctly.

This category helps you plan the data work that matters most before you purchase a migration service or commit to a go-live timeline.

### What this category helps you decide

#### What preparation is worth doing before you pay for migration

Not every cleanup task is worth the time. This section helps you identify the prep that reduces risk fastest and prevents avoidable surprises.

#### How to structure mapping decisions before execution

Mapping is where meaning is preserved. If mapping decisions are delayed, teams discover conflicts late, and the launch becomes reactive.

#### What “dirty data” will break outcomes

Dirty data often “works” in the old store because the platform, apps, or your team’s workarounds compensate for it. Migration exposes it. This section helps you identify the patterns most likely to cause broken variants, confusing categories, and inconsistent customer or order results.

### Who this sub-category is for

* **Store Owners / Business Owners:** reducing risk and preventing avoidable scope creep
* **Project Managers / Operations Leads:** defining dependencies, acceptance criteria, and timeline realism
* **eCommerce Managers:** improving catalog consistency, navigation quality, and merchandising usability
* **Marketing / SEO Specialists:** protecting priority pages and category intent by preserving clean structure
* **Technical Leads / Developers:** identifying feasibility risks and data-model conflicts early
* **Agencies / Consultants:** estimating effort and aligning stakeholders on what must be cleaned vs accepted

### The three preparation layers that matter most

#### Layer 1: Readiness and scope clarity

Before you migrate, you need to know what “done” means:

* which data types and behaviors are required for launch
* which parts of the store are priority (best sellers, top categories, key promotions, priority pages)
* what outcomes you will validate before go-live

#### Layer 2: Mapping decisions that preserve meaning

Mapping is not a spreadsheet exercise. It is a decision about how your store will function on the target platform:

* how variants and attributes should behave
* how categories and groupings should be represented
* how customer and order context should remain usable

#### Layer 3: Cleanup that prevents downstream problems

Cleanup is most valuable when it removes ambiguity:

* inconsistent option values and attribute formats
* duplicates and near-duplicates
* missing identifiers or inconsistent naming patterns
* category structures that do not reflect real browsing intent

**Expert insight**: The goal of preparation is not perfection. It is removing ambiguity that forces last-minute decisions.

### Common mistakes to avoid

* delaying mapping decisions until after migration starts
* cleaning everything instead of prioritizing what reduces risk
* assuming “the tool will handle it” without defining acceptance criteria
* ignoring inconsistent option/attribute values until variants behave incorrectly
* setting a launch date before readiness and validation ownership are defined

### What to validate early (fastest risk reduction)

Even before full execution, validate a representative sample mindset:

* best sellers with complex variants
* top category browsing paths
* a few repeat customers and support-relevant orders (if in scope)
* a handful of high-impact promotion scenarios (if critical to launch)

Early validation reduces waste by showing what actually needs cleanup versus what is acceptable as-is.

### Conclusion

A practical industry takeaway is that data preparation is where migration risk is won or lost. Most teams do not fail because they lacked a migration tool. They fail because inconsistent data and unclear mapping decisions force late rework. When you define scope outcomes, make mapping decisions early, and clean the data patterns that create ambiguity, your migration becomes predictable and your validation results become trustworthy.

If you want to reduce risk before committing budget or a launch date, start with a readiness pass on your highest-impact data: best sellers, top categories, and the option/attribute patterns that drive buying behavior.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I need to clean all my data before a migration?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. The highest ROI cleanup is the cleanup that removes ambiguity in high-impact areas: inconsistent variant options, duplicated products, messy attributes used for filtering, and category structures that affect discovery.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the most important thing to prepare before purchasing a migration service?</strong></summary>

Clarity on scope and success criteria. If you know what must remain true after launch and what you will validate, you can choose the right service approach and avoid late surprises.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Why does preparation matter if a service provider is doing the migration?</strong></summary>

Because you still define what a successful migration is. Preparation helps you make decisions early and validate with confidence.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Why do migrations “surface” problems that didn’t matter in the old store?</strong></summary>

Because the old platform, apps, or your team’s workarounds may have masked inconsistencies. A new platform can represent product structure, categories, attributes, and rules differently, which exposes messy data patterns and forces decisions.
