# What to Prepare Before You Purchase a Migration Service

Before you purchase a migration service, your goal is simple: reduce uncertainty. The better your preparation, the easier it becomes to choose the right service model, avoid scope creep, and prevent delays caused by late discovery.

This checklist focuses on what to clarify and gather at a decision level, not tool steps.

### Start with outcomes, not data lists

Instead of starting with “we need to migrate everything,” start with what must remain true after launch.

#### Conversion outcomes

* Shoppers can browse top categories and find products quickly.
* Variants and options behave the way customers expect.
* Pricing and promotions remain credible at checkout.

#### Operations and support outcomes

* Your team can find orders and resolve issues quickly.
* Customer accounts behave in a predictable way (including realistic login outcomes).
* Order history is usable enough to support returns, exchanges, and repeat purchases.

#### Marketing and trust outcomes

* Priority landing pages remain reachable and intent-consistent.
* Old links do not lead to dead ends.
* The store still communicates trust where it matters most (best sellers, policies, key content pages).

These outcomes become the basis for scope decisions and acceptance criteria.

### Define what data is truly in scope

Most teams assume “everything” is in scope. That usually creates confusion later. Define scope by category so you can make tradeoffs intentionally.

#### Core categories

* Products (including variants/options)
* Categories and catalog structure
* Customers
* Orders
* Blog posts (if applicable)

#### Supporting categories that often require explicit planning

* Product images and variant images
* Reviews and ratings
* CMS pages and marketing landing pages
* URL path continuity (redirect planning when URLs change)
* Promotions and coupons that drive meaningful revenue

If you cannot finalize scope yet, define what is most important to validate first.

### Identify early complexity signals

You do not need technical detail to spot where risk lives. Look for signals that usually drive extra planning:

* many variant combinations or inconsistent option naming
* deep category trees, curated collections, or complex navigation rules
* app-driven fields that influence filtering, pricing, or product display
* reviews stored in third-party systems
* promotions that rely on complex rule behavior (thresholds, exclusions, stacking)
* content-heavy stores where blog/CMS pages are traffic drivers

Complexity signals help you choose the right approach before you commit to a timeline.

### Choose a “validation sample” before you buy

Instead of validating everything at once, pick a sample that reveals complexity fast. A strong validation sample usually includes:

* Top 5-10 best sellers
* A few products with the most complex variants
* Top 3–5 categories by revenue and traffic
* A representative set of orders (multi-item, discounts, different time ranges)
* A few marketing-critical pages if content matters to your store

This sample becomes your baseline for early review and expectation alignment. If you plan to test before committing, use the sample with **Demo Migration: What It Proves and How to Read Results**.

### Align ownership before the project starts

Before purchase, confirm ownership for the work that prevents surprise:

* Who owns scope decisions?
* Who owns validation sign-off?
* Who owns go-live readiness?
* Who owns SEO continuity priorities?
* Who owns promotions and conversion-critical checkout behavior?

Even a small team benefits from named owners. When ownership is unclear, delays and last-minute compromises become the default.

### How Next-Cart helps you make pre-purchase decisions more predictable

Next-Cart reduces uncertainty before you commit by turning assumptions into evidence:

* **Entity Points** help quantify migration scope early so effort and cost are sized realistically.
* A **Demo Migration** helps validate how your real store data translates using your sample, not generic expectations.
* Service model becomes clearer:
  * **Standard Migration** is ideal when your data scope and mapping are straightforward. You maintain control over the execution with the benefit of 24/7 expert support to guide you.
  * **Managed Migration** is a hands-free option. Our professionals execute the entire migration process, leaving you only to verify that the final results meet your expectations.
  * **Custom Migration** is best suited for projects with complex databases and structures. Choose this when your data integrity requires custom handling (via Custom Jobs) or when you have specialized needs that demand a unique solution to preserve data meaning.

For the smoothest transition from planning to execution, your next critical step is to define how your current data will map to the new platform's structure. Consult our resource: **Data Mapping Strategy: Structuring Data for the Target Platform.**

### Conclusion

A practical industry pattern is that migration “surprises” are rarely mysterious. They are the predictable result of unclear scope, unowned validation, and assumptions that were never tested. Teams that prepare well do not prepare by documenting everything. They prepare by defining outcomes, spotting complexity signals, and validating a representative sample so decisions are evidence-based before money and timelines lock.

If you are deciding whether to purchase a migration service now, start by building a validation sample and clarifying your must-have outcomes (conversion, operations, and SEO continuity). If you want expert help identifying where your store is most likely to introduce scope creep and which service model is safest for your situation, reach out via Live Chat. Next-Cart can review your priorities, align expectations using Demo Migration results, and help you choose the right service approach without last-minute complications.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I need to choose a target platform before I start?</strong></summary>

It helps, but it is not always required. You can still clarify scope, complexity, and validation priorities first. Once the target is confirmed, mapping decisions become more concrete.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I need to prepare a full data export first?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. You mainly need clarity on what data exists, where complexity lives, and what must be validated. A demo-level proof point is often more useful than a large export file.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Is “Demo Migration” useful if I already know my catalog is large?</strong></summary>

Yes. Size is not the main risk. Structure is. A demo helps confirm how variants, categories, and key relationships will be represented on the target cart.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What if my source store has customizations?</strong></summary>

Customizations can change what “equivalent” looks like on the target platform. The safest approach is to identify which custom behaviors are business-critical and validate a representative sample early so you can choose the right service approach.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I migrate only specific data instead of everything?</strong></summary>

In many cases, yes, you can. Migrating all data isn't always necessary or efficient. Scope is typically defined by the data categories and outcomes that matter most to your business, for example, prioritizing essential items like products, customers, and recent orders first.

The key to successful selective migration is explicitly defining and agreeing on the scope before execution.

To perform a selective migration with precise control over which data is moved, you will need to leverage our Custom Migration Service. This model allows you to create specific data filters and logic tailored to your exact requirements, ensuring you only migrate the data you truly need.
