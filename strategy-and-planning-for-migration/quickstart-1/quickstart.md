# What to Prepare Before You Purchase a Migration Service

Before you purchase a migration service, your goal is simple: reduce uncertainty. The better your preparation, the easier it becomes to choose the right service model, avoid scope creep, and prevent delays caused by late discovery.

This page gives you a buyer-friendly preparation checklist. It focuses on what you should clarify and gather, not on tool steps.

#### 1) Clarify the outcome you want

Start with business outcomes, not data lists:

* What must remain true for conversion after launch?
* What must remain true for operations and customer support?
* What must remain true for marketing continuity and trust?

Examples of “must remain true” outcomes:

* Shoppers can browse top categories and select variants correctly
* Support can find customer orders and resolve issues quickly
* Key trust signals are present on best sellers
* Old links do not lead to dead ends after launch

#### 2) Define what data is truly in scope

Most stores assume “everything” is in scope. That usually creates confusion later. Instead, define scope by category:

Core migration categories:

* Products and variants
* Categories and catalog structure
* Customers
* Orders

Common supporting categories that may require planning:

* Product images and variant images
* Reviews and ratings
* Blog and CMS content
* URL path continuity for redirects when URLs change

If you cannot decide scope fully yet, define what is most important to validate first.

#### 3) Identify where complexity is likely

A few complexity signals to look for:

* Lots of variant combinations or inconsistent option naming
* Deep category trees or curated collections
* App-driven fields that influence filtering, pricing, or product display
* Reviews stored in third-party systems
* Promotions that rely on complex rule behavior

You do not need technical detail here. You just need to know where the risk lives.

#### 4) Choose your “validation sample” early

Instead of validating everything at once, pick a sample that reveals complexity fast:

* Top 10 best sellers
* A few products with the most complex variants
* Top 3 to 5 categories by revenue and traffic
* A set of representative orders (discounts, multi-item, different time ranges)
* A few marketing-critical pages if content matters for your store

This sample becomes your baseline for early review.

#### 5) Align ownership

Before purchase, confirm:

* Who owns scope decisions?
* Who owns validation sign-off?
* Who owns go-live readiness?
* Who owns SEO continuity priorities?

Migration is smoother when the decision owners are clear early.

#### How Next-Cart supports this preparation stage

Many teams struggle because they cannot tell whether they need basic execution help or deeper guidance. Next-Cart helps clarify that before you commit:

* **Entity Points** provide a measurable view of scope so you can size effort and cost realistically.
* **Demo Migration** lets you validate your sample with real results, not assumptions.
* The service model choice becomes clearer:
  * **Standard** when scope and mapping are straightforward
  * **Managed** when you want more guided mapping and validation support
  * **Custom** when preserving meaning requires custom handling through Custom Jobs

#### Conclusion

Preparation before purchase is about making the project predictable. Define must-have outcomes, scope, complexity signals, and a validation sample. Then choose a service model that matches your store reality and your internal capacity.

If you are unsure what service model you need, run a **Demo Migration** using your validation sample to confirm how your store data translates.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I need to choose a target platform before I start?</strong></summary>

It helps, but it is not always required. You can still clarify scope, complexity, and validation priorities first. Once the target is confirmed, mapping decisions become more concrete.

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I need to prepare a full data export first?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. You mainly need clarity on what data exists, where complexity lives, and what must be validated. A demo-level proof point is often more useful than a large export file.

<details>

<summary><strong>Is “Demo Migration” useful if I already know my catalog is large?</strong></summary>

Yes. Size is not the main risk. Structure is. A demo helps confirm how variants, categories, and key relationships will be represented on the target cart.
