# The SEO Migration Framework

An SEO migration framework is a planning method that helps you protect traffic during a shopping cart migration by reducing preventable errors. It does not promise rankings. It gives you a disciplined way to preserve reachability, keep signals consistent, and monitor what happens after go-live.

Use this framework whether you migrate with an internal team, an agency, or a migration service.

#### Framework overview

Use this framework as six phases. Each phase has a clear output that helps reduce uncertainty.

1. **Define what must be protected**
2. **Build a URL mapping plan**
3. **Plan redirect strategy**
4. **Preserve and validate key signals**
5. **Launch with controlled cutover**
6. **Monitor and stabilize**

#### Phase 1: Define what must be protected

Start by defining which pages matter most to protect. Beginners often assume every page has equal value, but most sites have a small set of pages that drive the majority of revenue and organic entry.

Create a short list:

* Top revenue-driving products and categories
* Top organic landing pages
* Evergreen content that earns links
* Brand trust pages that customers search for

This list becomes your “priority set” for mapping, redirect coverage, and monitoring.

#### Phase 2: Build a URL mapping plan

A URL mapping plan is a translation layer from old site URLs to new site URLs. It answers one question:

> For each meaningful old URL, what is the best matching new URL?

A strong mapping plan follows simple rules:

* One old URL should map to one relevant new URL whenever possible
* Consolidations are acceptable only when content truly merges
* Avoid redirecting large sets of unrelated URLs to the home page

**Expert insight:** Redirects are not only for SEO. They protect revenue by preventing dead ends from old email links, ads, and bookmarks.

#### Phase 3: Plan redirect strategy

Redirects operationalize your mapping. They help users and search engines reach the new pages from old links and search results.

Your redirect strategy should clarify:

* Which URLs changed and require redirects
* How you will avoid redirect chains and loops
* What happens to retired pages, if any

Next-Cart is designed to migrate old URL paths into your new website's redirection system, reducing the manual burden of building redirects from scratch when URL structures change.

#### Phase 4: Preserve and validate key signals

Even with correct redirects, SEO can suffer if signals become inconsistent.

Your signal validation should confirm:

* Important pages are indexable and crawlable
* Canonical signals point to the correct preferred URL
* Internal links resolve to the intended final pages, not dead ends
* Duplicate content is not created unintentionally by URL structure changes

This phase is often where teams discover that “the pages exist” but are not being interpreted correctly.

#### Phase 5: Launch with controlled cutover

A controlled cutover is a launch plan designed to reduce chaos.

**Principles**:

* Choose a low-risk window when the team can monitor
* Ensure redirect coverage is live at launch
* Avoid bundling major content rewrites with the platform switch if you can
* Keep a rollback plan for critical failures

#### Phase 6: Monitor and stabilize

Monitoring confirms whether the move is being understood and whether users are hitting dead ends.

**Focus on**:

* Redirect coverage for priority pages
* Crawl errors and unexpected dead ends
* Whether important old URLs are resolving to the correct new URLs
* Whether indexing of new pages is improving over time

This is where you move from “we launched” to “we stabilized”.

#### How Next-Cart supports the framework

Next-Cart’s role in this framework is to help keep customer and search traffic paths intact during a cart move by supporting URL path continuity:

* **Redirect-path migration:** migrate old URL paths to the redirect system on the new website
* **301 continuity approach:** use permanent redirects for moved paths so the change is clearly communicated
* **Plugin support when needed:** provide a redirects plugin when the target platform does not support redirects by default
* **Scope clarity:** treat redirects as a migration deliverable, not an afterthought

What you get:

* fewer broken-link surprises at launch
* clearer continuity for users and search engines
* a migration plan that includes SEO reachability as a first-class requirement

#### Common pitfalls this framework prevents

* Treating redirects as a last-minute task
* Redirecting large sets of old URLs to irrelevant destinations
* Creating long redirect chains that add latency and complexity
* Launching without clear monitoring ownership
* Changing URL structure, content, and information architecture all at once without a validation plan

#### Conclusion

An SEO migration framework works because it is disciplined. Map priority URLs, prepare redirect handling, validate, then monitor.

If your store has many indexed pages or complex URL structures, treat redirect continuity as part of your migration scope, not an optional add-on.

<summary><strong>Is it better to change URLs during replatforming or keep them the same?</strong></summary>

If you can keep URLs stable without compromising the new platform, that reduces risk. If you must change URLs, mapping and redirects become essential.

<summary><strong>Do redirects reduce PageRank?</strong></summary>

Google states that 301, 302, and other server-side redirects do not cause a loss of PageRank.

<summary><strong>How long should redirects remain in place after a move?</strong></summary>

We recommend keeping redirects as long as possible and generally at least one year to allow signals to transfer.

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the biggest success factor for SEO during migration?</strong></summary>

Clear URL mapping and redirect correctness for pages that matter most, combined with monitoring ownership after launch.
