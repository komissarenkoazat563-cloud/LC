# Common Risks in E-commerce Migration

Most migration failures are not caused by a single dramatic mistake. They are caused by small gaps that compound: **unclear scope**, **hidden data dependencies**, **rushed validation**, and **mismanaged SEO changes**.

Below are the most common risks and the practical ways to reduce them, even if you are new to the migration process.

#### Risk 1: Migrating the wrong scope

**What it looks like:**

* Products migrate, but merchandising logic breaks
* Orders exist, but support cannot reference them effectively
* Key content or promotions are missing

**How to reduce it:**

* Define must-have outcomes for catalog, customers, orders, content, and SEO
* Document what data is native versus app or custom

#### Risk 2: Data compatibility mismatches

**What it looks like:**

* Variant structures do not fit the target model
* Categories or collections cannot represent your navigation
* Discounts and tax rules behave differently after launch

**How to reduce it:**

* Identify complexity drivers early
* Expect some data to require mapping decisions, not just transfer

#### Risk 3: SEO traffic loss from URL changes

**What it looks like:**

* Important pages drop in rankings
* Organic traffic declines after launch
* Redirect coverage is incomplete

**How to reduce it:**

* Treat redirects as a core deliverable, not an afterthought
* Plan verification and monitoring after launch

#### Risk 4: Underestimating validation effort

**What it looks like:**

* Team validates only counts, not relationships
* Issues appear only after customers complain
* Launch happens without a clear sign-off

**How to reduce it:**

* Use a validation checklist that includes relationships and critical workflows
* Assign a validation owner and define sign-off criteria

#### Risk 5: Go-live timing and coordination mistakes

**What it looks like:**

* Go-live overlaps with campaigns or peak periods
* Teams are unsure who approves the final cutover
* Post-launch monitoring is reactive and chaotic

**How to reduce it:**

* Build a go-live plan with roles and escalation paths
* Schedule a monitoring window for the first 72 hours

#### Risk 6: Customer experience disruption

**What it looks like:**

* Login confusion, missing order history expectations, or changed account behavior
* Increased support volume
* Lower trust during the transition

**How to reduce it:**

* Plan customer communication
* Train support on the expected differences and known limitations
