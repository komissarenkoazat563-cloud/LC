# Migration Readiness Scorecard

A migration succeeds when the scope is clear, the data is understood, and the ownership is defined. This scorecard helps you assess readiness objectively and identify what to fix before you purchase a migration service or commit to a timeline.

**Expert insight:** The most common readiness gap is not data transfer. It is validation ownership and unclear success criteria.

#### How to score

For each area, score yourself:

* 0: not ready
* 1: partially ready
* 2: ready

Total possible: 20 points.

#### **Interpretation**

**0 to 9: High risk**\
You are likely to experience scope changes, delays, or post-launch issues. Focus on clarifying scope and ownership before committing.

**10 to 15: Moderate risk**\
You can proceed, but strengthen the lowest areas, especially data awareness and validation.

**16 to 20: Strong readiness**\
You are positioned for a controlled migration. Stay disciplined on validation and go-live monitoring.

#### **Readiness areas**

| Area                                    | 0 Point                                 | 1 Point                                 | 2 Poin                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clear reason for migration**          | Unclear goals                           | Goals exist but are not prioritized     | Goals are specific and measurable                      |
| **Scope clarity**                       | Unsure what must migrate                | Partial scope list                      | Must have data types and outcomes are defined          |
| **Data awareness**                      | No idea where key data lives            | Some knowledge, apps not mapped         | Native versus app or custom data is identified         |
| **Catalog complexity awareness**        | Unknown variant and category complexity | Partially understood                    | Complexity drivers are documented                      |
| **Order history requirements**          | Unclear how far back you need orders    | Some requirements                       | Order continuity needs are defined                     |
| **Customer account expectations**       | No plan for account continuity impacts  | Awareness but no plan                   | Plan exists for communication and support load         |
| **SEO and redirect planning ownership** | No SEO owner                            | SEO owner exists but no plan            | Redirect and SEO validation plan exists                |
| **Target platform readiness**           | Target platform not selected            | Selected but requirements not finalized | Requirements are defined and aligned                   |
| **Validation ownership**                | Nobody owns sign off                    | Owner exists but criteria unclear       | Validation criteria and sign-off process defined       |
| **Timeline realism**                    | Launch date fixed with no buffer        | Timeline exists but QA is compressed    | Timeline includes test, QA, and post launch monitoring |

#### What to do if your score is low

Start with the fastest risk reducers:

* Inventory your core data types and where they come from
* Identify app-driven or custom data early
* Define what success means for catalog, orders, customers, and SEO
* Assign a validation owner and a launch owner

#### How Next-Cart improves readiness when your score is low

When readiness is low, the obstacle is usually uncertainty about data shape and migration feasibility.

Next-Cart helps you move from uncertainty to clarity by producing concrete outputs:

* **Audit and scope definition:** clarify what data will be migrated and what needs decisions
* **Entity Points sizing:** quantify scope so stakeholders align on effort and expectations
* **Demo Migration:** show real migrated samples early so you can validate structure and relationships
* **Validation checklist:** establish pass criteria for the business before go-live planning

**Outcome**: readiness becomes measurable and actionable, rather than a subjective feeling.

#### Conclusion

Readiness is about clarity, not perfection. Define success, assign validation ownership, and validate early.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the most common readiness gap?</strong></summary>

Validation ownership and unclear success criteria. Many teams assume a vendor will “handle it”, but only your business can define what success means.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I still migrate if my readiness score is low?</strong></summary>

Yes, but you should expect more iteration and risk. Address the lowest-scoring categories before you commit to a launch date.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Does a higher readiness score mean a shorter timeline?</strong></summary>

Not always. Higher readiness usually means fewer surprises and rework, which makes timelines more predictable.
