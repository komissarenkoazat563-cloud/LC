# Post-Migration SEO Audit: What to Verify After Launch

After launch, SEO continuity depends on two things:

* Whether search engines can crawl and understand your new site cleanly
* Whether old URLs lead users to the right new URLs through redirects when structures change

Even when everything is done correctly, rankings can fluctuate temporarily after a migration. The goal of an SEO audit is to confirm that changes are controlled, intentional, and recoverable.

This audit is written for decision support and planning. It does not include tool-specific instructions.

#### 1) Confirm that priority pages are reachable

Start with outcomes, not dashboards.

**Checklist**:

* Top revenue product pages load correctly
* Top category pages load correctly
* Key landing pages load correctly
* Site navigation does not produce unexpected dead ends

#### 2) Validate redirects for high-value old URLs

If URLs changed, redirects are essential.

**Checklist**:

* High-traffic old product URLs redirect to the correct new product URL
* High-traffic old category URLs redirect to the correct new category URL
* Redirects do not chain repeatedly (old to intermediate to final)
* Redirect destinations are relevant, not generic

Next-Cart’s SEO URL Redirects approach migrates old URL paths into the redirect system on the new website. After you transfer your domain to the new site, old URLs can redirect users to the correct new destinations.

#### 3) Check canonical and duplicate URL behavior

Many SEO issues come from duplicates rather than missing pages.

**Checklist**:

* Each important page has one primary URL
* Duplicate variants of the same page do not compete with each other
* Canonical behavior is consistent across product and category pages

#### 4) Confirm indexation is trending correctly

This is not an instant result. You are checking direction and signals.

**Checklist**:

* New URLs are being discovered and indexed
* Old URLs begin to drop over time if redirects are in place
* Coverage errors are not rising sharply

#### 5) Review critical metadata parity

Metadata changes can alter search presentation even when pages load.

**Checklist**:

* Key pages have reasonable titles and meta descriptions
* Product pages have consistent heading structure
* Structured content like product names, categories, and descriptions is present and not truncated

#### 6) Validate sitemap and crawl hygiene

Your goal is to make crawling efficient.

**Checklist**:

* The site exposes a clear path for crawling core pages
* Unimportant pages do not dominate crawling attention
* Error pages are not proliferating

#### 7) Watch performance signals that influence SEO

Performance is not only an engineering concern. It influences conversion and can affect search visibility.

**Checklist**:

* Page load and interaction feel stable on key templates
* Category pages and search pages remain responsive
* Mobile experience is usable for purchase journeys

#### What “good” looks like in the first 2 to 4 weeks

* Some ranking fluctuation is normal
* Redirect behavior is consistent and does not degrade over time
* Indexation gradually shifts from old URLs to new URLs
* Crawl errors trend downward after initial discovery

#### Conclusion

A post-migration SEO audit is about controlling the transition: clean crawling, intentional redirects, and stable page templates.
