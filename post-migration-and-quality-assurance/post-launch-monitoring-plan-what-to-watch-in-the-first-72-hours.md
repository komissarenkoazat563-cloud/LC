# Post-launch Monitoring Plan: What to Watch in the First 72 Hours

The first 72 hours after launch are when small issues become visible. Monitoring is not about panic. It is about quickly confirming that the new store is functioning as a business, not just as a website.

This plan focuses on what to watch, how to interpret signals, and what to document for follow-up.

#### Monitoring principles

* Watch outcomes first: orders, payments, customer actions, traffic continuity
* Triage based on severity: revenue-impacting issues first
* Record patterns: one-off anomalies vs systemic failures
* Keep a running log: what happened, when, and who owns next action

#### First 2 hours: confirm business continuity

**Checklist**:

* Orders can be placed successfully end-to-end
* Payment success rate looks normal for your business
* Confirmation emails and operational notifications are functioning
* Top pages load reliably: home, key categories, best sellers, cart, checkout
* Redirects for priority URLs behave as expected
* Customer support has a clear path for reporting issues

#### First 24 hours: confirm stability and discoverability

**Checklist**:

* Traffic patterns are plausible relative to baseline
* 404 volume is not spiking across priority URLs
* Category browsing and search paths behave as expected
* Inventory and pricing behavior is stable for top products
* Key integrations are functioning at a basic outcome level (for example orders flowing where they should)

#### 24 to 72 hours: confirm recovery signals and refine

**Checklist**:

* SEO signals begin trending correctly (discovery, crawl, and redirect coverage)
* High-value old URLs are consistently resolving
* Customer feedback trends are understood (confusion points, purchase friction)
* Any issues found are categorized and assigned owners with deadlines
* A post-launch improvement list is created for non-critical enhancements

#### Create a simple severity rubric

Use a consistent system so your team moves fast:

* Severity 1: blocks purchasing or causes revenue loss
* Severity 2: degrades shopping experience materially (wrong variant behavior, missing key pages)
* Severity 3: cosmetic or minor content issues (can be scheduled)
