# WooCommerce Migration Hub

WooCommerce is a popular target for businesses that want flexibility and control because it is an **open-source e-commerce platform built on WordPress**.

That flexibility is also what makes WooCommerce migrations unique: stores often rely on plugins, custom fields, and hosting-specific behavior that can change what “the same data” means after migration.

### How to use this hub

Start here based on your situation:

* Newer stores or simpler catalogs: **Fit**, then **Preparation**
* Plugin-heavy stores: **Data Model**, **Constraints**, and **Pitfalls**
* SEO-sensitive stores: **Constraints**, then **Validation**

#### Hub pages

1. **WooCommerce Fit**
2. **WooCommerce Data Model Differences**: What changes and why it matters
3. **WooCommerce Constraints and Risk**
4. **Pre-migration Preparation Checklist**
5. **Choosing the Right Migration Approach**
6. **WooCommerce Validation Priorities**
7. **Common Pitfalls and Prevention**

#### Conclusion

WooCommerce can be a great target when you want flexibility, but migration success depends on planning for plugin-driven data, hosting variability, and custom field consistency.

If you are unsure how much of your store depends on plugins and custom fields, a **Demo Migration** is a fast way to reveal real mapping outcomes before you commit to a full migration.
