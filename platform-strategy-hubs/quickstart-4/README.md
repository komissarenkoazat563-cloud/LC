# Magneto Migration Hub

Magento is often chosen when a business needs deep catalog flexibility, multi-store capabilities, and extensibility. That power comes with complexity, especially in how product data, attributes, and storefront structures are modeled.

This hub helps you plan a **shopping cart migration to Magento** with clear expectations:

* What changes in Magento’s data model and why it matters
* Where complexity hides (attributes, multi-store, custom modules, search requirements)
* Which migration approach fits best: Standard, Managed, or Custom
* What to validate first to avoid late surprises

#### Hub pages

1. Magento Fit: who it is and is not a strong target for
2. Magento Data Model Differences: product types, attributes, attribute sets, multi-store
3. Constraints and Risk: what it means, who it affects, mitigation paths
4. Pre-migration Preparation Checklist
5. Choosing the Right Migration Approach
6. Validation Priorities: what to verify most carefully
7. Common Pitfalls and Prevention

#### Conclusion

Magento supports sophisticated commerce, but migration success depends on getting catalog meaning right: product types, attribute structure, and store scope.

If Magento is a top candidate and your catalog uses many attributes, variations, or multiple storefronts, a **Demo Migration** is the fastest way to confirm how your real data translates before committing to full scope.
