# Choosing the Right Migration Approach for Magento

Magento migrations reward risk-aware planning. The right approach depends on catalog complexity, attribute structure, multi-store scope, and internal capacity for validation.

#### Standard Migration is usually suitable when

* Attribute sets are clean and consistent
* Product types are straightforward
* Single storefront, limited scope complexity
* Your team can own mapping decisions and QA sign-off

#### Managed Migration is usually suitable when

* Attributes drive key browsing and filtering behavior
* Product types are complex (configurable, bundle, grouped)
* Multi-store scope is involved
* You want expert-led mapping decisions and structured validation support

#### Custom Migration is usually suitable when

* You need transformations to preserve meaning across attributes, product relationships, or store scopes
* You have edge cases that cannot be handled by standard mapping
* You need Managed support plus Custom Jobs to meet required outcomes

Magento’s flexible attribute system and store scope hierarchy often make **Managed** or **Custom** support valuable when the store is non-trivial.

#### Conclusion

Approach selection is risk management. If attributes and scope decisions must be correct on the first pass, **Managed** or **Custom** often protects both timeline and quality.

Use a **Demo Migration** as the decision trigger. If the demo reveals attribute inconsistency, complex product types, or multi-store scope risk, choose Managed or Custom based on what must remain true.
