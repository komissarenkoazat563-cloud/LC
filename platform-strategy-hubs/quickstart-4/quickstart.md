# Magento Fit: Who Magento is (and is not) good for

Magento is a strong target when you need a flexible catalog model, advanced merchandising rules, and a multi-store setup under one installation. It can also be a heavier operational commitment than simpler platforms, so fit is as much about internal capacity as it is about features.

#### Magento is often a strong fit when

* You have a complex catalog with many attributes that drive filtering, search, and merchandising
* You need multiple websites, stores, or store views for regions, brands, or languages within one system
* You expect ongoing customization via extensions or custom development

#### Magento can be a harder fit when

Magento can still work, but risk and effort often increase if:

* Your team wants minimal technical ownership after launch
* Your store depends on deep customization but the requirements are not clearly defined
* You need to move quickly without time for structured validation, since Magento complexity often demands a more deliberate QA process

#### A beginner-friendly way to judge fit

If your store depends on any of these, Magento fit tends to improve:

* Complex product types (configurable, bundle, grouped) that must behave correctly after migration
* Attribute-driven filtering and browsing, where catalog structure is part of the shopping experience
* Multi-store or multi-language requirements with different base URLs and store scope

#### Where Next-Cart fits naturally

Magento projects often start with a planning gap: teams underestimate how much meaning lives in attributes, attribute sets, and store scope. Next-Cart helps reduce that uncertainty by:

* Using **Entity Points** to measure scope beyond surface counts
* Running a **Demo Migration** that shows how your attribute structure, product types, and store hierarchy behave in the target environment
* Matching the right service model when complexity requires expert-led mapping decisions

If your store uses many product attributes or multiple storefronts, run a **Demo Migration** using complex products and high-value categories to confirm Magento fits with evidence.
