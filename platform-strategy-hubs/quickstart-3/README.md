# BigCommerce Migration Hub

This hub helps you plan a **platform migration to BigCommerce** by answering:

* What changes in BigCommerce’s catalog model, and why it matters
* The constraints that can affect complex catalogs, URLs, and integrations
* Which migration approach fits best: Standard, Managed, or Custom
* What to validate first to avoid late surprises

#### Hub pages

1. BigCommerce Fit: who it is and is not a strong target for
2. BigCommerce Data Model Differences: catalog, variants, modifiers, categories, custom data, content
3. Constraints and Risk: what it means, who it affects, mitigation paths
4. Pre-migration Preparation Checklist
5. Choosing the Right Migration Approach
6. Validation Priorities: what to verify most carefully
7. Common Pitfalls and Prevention

#### Conclusion

BigCommerce migrations go smoothly when you plan around catalog structure, variant and option rules, and the realities of redirects and API throughput.

If BigCommerce is a top candidate and your catalog is complex, a **Demo Migration** with **Next-Cart** is the fastest way to confirm how your real products, variants, and category assignments translate before committing to full execution.
