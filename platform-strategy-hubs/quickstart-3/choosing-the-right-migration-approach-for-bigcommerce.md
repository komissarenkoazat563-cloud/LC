# Choosing the Right Migration Approach for BigCommerce

The “right” approach is the one that protects outcomes given your risk profile and internal capacity. Use this matrix to choose **Standard**, **Managed**, or **Custom Migration Service**.

#### Standard Migration is usually suitable when

* Your variants are within practical limits and structured cleanly
* Your category structure is straightforward
* Custom fields are minimal or not critical to shopping decisions
* Your team can own mapping decisions and validation sign-off

#### Managed Migration is usually suitable when

* You have configurable products that require careful variant vs modifier decisions
* Category trees and channel structure matter
* Custom fields and attributes must remain visible and usable
* You want expert-led mapping decisions and guided QA

#### Custom Migration is usually suitable when

* Business-critical meaning requires transformations or special handling
* You have edge cases where standard mapping will not preserve behavior
* You need Managed support plus Custom Jobs to meet the required outcomes

#### How BigCommerce realities influence the choice

* Variant SKUs per product and option value ceilings can drive the need for expert-led restructuring.
* Multi-storefront category trees can raise mapping complexity.
* API rate limits can increase timeline sensitivity for large stores.

#### Conclusion

Approach selection is risk management. If catalog structure decisions must be correct the first time, Managed or Custom often protects time and quality.

Use a **Demo Migration** result as the decision trigger. If the demo shows variant restructuring, category tree complexity, or custom attribute dependency, select **Managed** or **Custom** based on what must remain true.
