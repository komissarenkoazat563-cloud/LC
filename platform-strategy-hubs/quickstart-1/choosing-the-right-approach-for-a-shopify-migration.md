# Choosing the Right Approach for a Shopify Migration

The right approach is the one that matches risk and internal capacity, not the one that sounds fastest.

Use this as a planning tool to choose Standard, Managed, or Custom migration support.

| Approach               | Best fit when                                                                                          | Risk profile             | What you must validate                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Migration** | Data is clean, catalog structure is consistent, limited custom data                                    | Lower                    | Best sellers, variant integrity, core collections, basic SEO priorities                                   |
| **Managed Migration**  | Complexity is moderate to high, internal bandwidth is limited, you want expert-led validation planning | Medium                   | Complex variants, collections logic, custom data usability, orders and customer continuity, priority URLs |
| **Custom Migration**   | You have special rules, app-driven dependencies, or non-standard structures that require Custom Jobs   | Higher, but controllable | Everything in Managed, plus explicit sign-off on custom transformations and edge-case behaviors           |

#### Standard Migration is usually suitable when

* Product variants are straightforward and consistent
* Collections and navigation can be represented cleanly
* Custom data is minimal or non-critical
* Your team can own validation and sign-off confidently

**Best for:** clean data, clear expectations, minimal edge cases.

#### Managed Migration is usually suitable when

* Variant structure is complex or inconsistent
* Collections and navigation have many high-value paths
* You rely on apps for important storefront behavior
* You want expert-led mapping decisions and guided QA

**Best for:** higher risk, limited internal bandwidth, need for stronger validation discipline.

#### Custom Migration is usually suitable when

* Business-critical meaning cannot be preserved through standard mapping
* You need special handling for custom fields, rules, or transformations
* App-driven data needs non-standard continuity outcomes
* You want Managed support plus Custom Jobs to handle real-world edge cases

**Best for:** complex stores with special requirements that must remain true after launch.

#### How Shopify constraints influence approach choice

* High variants and option complexity often pushes toward **Managed** or **Custom** because mapping and validation effort increases
* Custom data dependency often increases risk and may require **Custom Jobs** for continuity outcomes
* URL changes with strict redirect constraints often benefit from more guided planning and validation

#### Conclusion

Approach selection is risk management. Choose based on what must remain true and who can own the work required to prove it.

If you are between two options, use a **Demo Migration** sample as a tiebreaker. Evidence usually makes the right approach clear. Or simply reach out via **Live Chat** to receive expert consultation and support.
