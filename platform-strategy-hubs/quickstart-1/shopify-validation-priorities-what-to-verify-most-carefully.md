# Shopify Validation Priorities: What to Verify Most Carefully

Validation is how you convert “we migrated” into “we can launch”. For Shopify, the highest value validation is behavior-based: browsing, variant selection, and continuity of key customer and SEO paths.

#### Priority 1: Variant integrity and option logic

**Validate**:

* Options are named and ordered consistently
* Variants represent real purchasable combinations
* High-variant products behave correctly in your storefront context

#### Priority 2: Collection and navigation outcomes

**Validate**:

* Top collections contain the correct products
* Smart collection rules behave as intended
* Browse paths match how customers shop

#### Priority 3: Media association and presentation

**Validate**:

* Best sellers have correct images and galleries
* Variant image behavior matches expectations
* Media-heavy products stay within Shopify’s per-product limits

#### Priority 4: Custom data visibility

**Validate**:

* Metafields that matter appear where needed
* Filtering and smart collection logic based on metafields behaves as expected

#### Priority 5: Customer and order usability

**Validate**:

* Customer records are findable and usable
* Representative orders provide support workflows
* If migrating historical orders, ensure relationships are intact and sequencing is planned

#### Priority 6: URL continuity and redirects

**Validate**:

* Priority old URLs resolve to the right destinations
* Redirects comply with Shopify restrictions and reserved paths

#### Conclusion

Shopify validation is less about totals and more about customer paths. Validate what drives conversion first, then confirm operational usability, then confirm SEO continuity.

If you only validate one slice, validate best sellers with complex variants and the collections that drive the most revenue. That reveals risk fastest.
