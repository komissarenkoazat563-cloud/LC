# Shopify Migration Hub

This hub helps you plan a **platform migration to Shopify** with the right expectations. It focuses on what changes, what constraints matter, and how to choose the right migration approach based on risk and complexity.

#### What Shopify changes in a migration, at a glance

Shopify’s model is standardized and predictable, but it expects your data to fit a specific structure:

* Products are built around options and variants, with known limits
* Catalog organization is primarily driven by collections (manual and rule-based)
* Custom data is typically handled through metafields and related custom data tools
* Redirects are supported, but with reserved paths and hard limitations

#### How to use this hub

Read based on your situation:

* If you are early-stage: start with **Fit** and **Constraints**
* If you have a complex catalog: start with **Data Model** and **Validation Priorities**
* If you are choosing service level: go to **Choosing the Right Approach**

#### Hub pages

1. **Shopify Fit**: Who Shopify is (and is not) good for
2. **Shopify Data Model Differences**: What changes and why it matters
3. **Shopify Constraints and Risk**: What it means, who it affects, mitigation paths
4. **Pre-migration Preparation Checklist**
5. **Choosing the Right Migration Approach**
6. **Shopify Validation Priorities**: what to verify most carefully
7. **Common Pitfalls and Prevention**

#### Conclusion

Shopify can be a strong target when you want predictable operations, but success depends on planning around the Shopify model, validating the right risks early, and choosing a migration approach that matches complexity.

If Shopify is a top candidate and your catalog has complex variants or SEO sensitivity, a **Demo Migration** (you run it or request Next-Cart to perform with your sample data) is the fastest way to confirm how your real data translates before you commit fully.
