# Shopify Fit: Who Shopify is (and is not) good for

Shopify tends to work best when you want a stable, standardized commerce foundation and you are willing to fit store behavior into Shopify’s model.

The best way to assess fit is to look at your catalog structure, customization dependency, and internal capacity.

#### Shopify is often a strong fit when

* You prefer predictable operations over deep platform-level customization
* Your catalog structure is consistent and not dependent on unusual data patterns
* You want to reduce ongoing infrastructure ownership
* You can meet merchandising needs through standard product and collection structures

#### Shopify can be a harder fit when

Shopify can still work, but risk goes up when:

* Products require more than three option dimensions (for example size + color + material + style)
* A single product requires extremely high variant counts, or relies on special behavior across apps, themes, or channels
* Your store is dependent on heavily customized fields and logic that must appear everywhere consistently (product page, filtering, search, feeds)

#### What beginners should expect

* Shopify is opinionated about product structure and catalog organization
* Your data can migrate, but it may not behave the same without intentional mapping and validation
* If your store relies on apps for core behaviors, you should treat apps as part of migration scope, not a post-launch detail

#### Where the migration approach matters most for Shopify

Fit is not only about Shopify. It is about how much help you need to get there safely:

* Clean, consistent data often fits **Standard Migration**
* Complex variants, deep catalog logic, or heavy app dependence often benefits from **Managed Migration**
* Non-standard requirements that must be preserved often push toward **Custom Migration** with **Custom Jobs**

#### Conclusion

Shopify is usually a strong fit for predictable commerce, but complexity can still create risk. Fit becomes clear when you assess variant structure, collection strategy, and custom data dependency.

If you are unsure about fit because of catalog complexity, use a **Demo Migration** with best sellers and complex products to validate real Shopify behavior early.

Often yes, but complexity increases validation needs. Start by testing how your most complex products behave after migration.
