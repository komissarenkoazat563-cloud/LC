# PrestaShop Fit: Who PrestaShop is (and is not) good for

PrestaShop is often chosen for flexibility and cost control, especially for stores that want customization without moving to a fully enterprise platform. Fit is usually determined by two practical questions:

* How much of your store’s behavior depends on modules
* Whether you need multistore and how complex your catalog combinations are

#### PrestaShop is often a strong fit when

* You want an open-source platform with a large module ecosystem
* Your catalog complexity is manageable and does not rely on highly bespoke logic
* You want WordPress-like flexibility in how features are extended, via modules and theme customization
* You want multistore capabilities under one back office when needed (for example B2B vs B2C or multiple domains)

#### PrestaShop can be a harder fit when

PrestaShop can still work, but risk tends to increase when:

* Your store relies on many modules that each add critical data or logic
* Multiple modules change the same core behavior, creating conflicts
* Your team needs highly standardized operations with minimal ongoing technical ownership
* Your product catalog has extremely large sets of combinations that become difficult to manage and validate

#### Where Next-Cart fits naturally

PrestaShop projects often fail in planning, not in execution, because teams discover module dependency and data structure issues late.

Next-Cart reduces that uncertainty by:

* Using **Entity Points** to quantify scope beyond surface counts
* Using a **Demo Migration** to show how your products, categories, customers, and URL paths translate into the target environment
* Matching the project to **Standard**, **Managed**, or **Custom** support when module dependency increases risk

If your store depends on modules for core revenue behavior (pricing rules, checkout logic, catalogs, or SEO), run a **Demo Migration** using best sellers and module-sensitive products to confirm fit before choosing an approach.
