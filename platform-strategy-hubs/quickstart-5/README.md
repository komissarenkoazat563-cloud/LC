# PrestaShop Migration Hub

PrestaShop is an open-source e-Commerce platform where store behavior often depends on modules, theme choices, and server environment.

That flexibility is valuable, but it also means shopping cart migration planning should focus on where meaning and logic actually live.

This hub helps you plan a **platform migration to PrestaShop** by answering:

* What changes in PrestaShop’s data model and why it matters
* The biggest risks: modules, multistore scope, combinations, and URL behavior
* Which approach fits best: Standard, Managed, or Custom
* What to validate first so go-live risk stays controlled

#### Hub pages

1. PrestaShop Fit: who it is and is not a strong target for
2. PrestaShop Data Model Differences: products, combinations, attributes, categories, content, orders
3. Constraints and Risk: modules, multistore, URLs, and environment variability
4. Pre-migration Preparation Checklist (conceptual)
5. Choosing the Right Migration Approach (neutral matrix)
6. Validation Priorities: what to verify most carefully
7. Common Pitfalls and Prevention

#### Conclusion

PrestaShop migrations succeed when you plan around module dependency, catalog combinations, multistore scope, and URL continuity.

If PrestaShop is a top candidate and your store uses multiple modules for core behavior, a **Demo Migration** is the fastest way to see what migrates cleanly and what needs special handling before you commit fully.
