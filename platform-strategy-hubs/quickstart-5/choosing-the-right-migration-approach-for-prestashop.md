# Choosing the Right Migration Approach for PrestaShop

The right approach is the one that protects quality given your risk profile and internal capacity. Use this matrix to choose Standard, Managed, or Custom.

#### Standard Migration is usually suitable when

* Catalog combinations are straightforward and consistent
* Module dependency is low for core buying behavior
* Multistore is not used, or store contexts are simple
* Your team can own validation and sign-off confidently

#### Managed Migration is usually suitable when

* Combinations and attributes create high validation risk
* Modules affect pricing, checkout, or product behavior
* Multistore exists and scope decisions matter
* You want expert-led mapping decisions and structured QA

#### Custom Migration is usually suitable when

* You need transformations or special handling to preserve meaning
* Module-driven data must carry over in a specific way
* Your store has edge cases that cannot be handled by standard mapping
* You need Managed support plus Custom Jobs to meet required outcomes

PrestaShop’s module ecosystem and the risks around overrides and compatibility make evidence-based approach selection especially valuable.

Use a **Demo Migration** as the decision trigger. If the demo reveals module dependency or complex combination mapping, choose Managed or Custom based on what must remain true after launch.
