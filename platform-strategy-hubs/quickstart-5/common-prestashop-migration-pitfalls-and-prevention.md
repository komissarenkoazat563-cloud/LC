# Common PrestaShop Migration Pitfalls and Prevention

Most PrestaShop migration issues are predictable. Prevention is about planning module scope, combination behavior, multistore context, and URL continuity early.

#### Pitfall 1: Treating modules as “post-launch setup”

Modules often define critical behavior.

**Prevention**: inventory modules early and classify which ones affect revenue and operations.

#### Pitfall 2: Combination sprawl from inconsistent attributes

Combinations are built from attributes, so inconsistent attribute data multiplies into many variation errors.

**Prevention**: standardize attribute groups and values before mapping.

#### Pitfall 3: Underestimating multistore scope decisions

Multistore is powerful, but it multiplies validation and mapping.

**Prevention**: define shared versus store-specific outcomes and validate per store context.

#### Pitfall 4: Module conflicts caused by overrides

PrestaShop warns overrides are exclusive and can create compatibility issues.

**Prevention**: reduce override reliance where possible and validate module interactions early.

#### Pitfall 5: Leaving SEO continuity until the end

Friendly URLs and canonical behavior require validation, and redirects require a plan.

**Prevention**: build a priority URL list early and validate outcomes before go-live.

#### Pitfall 6: Measuring scope only by product count

Complexity can live in combinations, modules, and multistore context.

**Prevention**: use a scope model that accounts for complexity, not just totals.

**Next-Cart insight**: Entity Points can help you size scope realistically, and a Demo Migration reveals where complexity actually sits.

If you recognize two or more pitfalls above, **Managed Migration** is often the safest choice because mapping and validation become structured and expert-led instead of improvised late.
